 Best Visual Best Makeup, BAFTA awards. Batman Returns s budget was an estimated $80 million, grossing $266,822,354 worldwide but Warner Bros. was disappointed as it was still substantially less than the first film. Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer for Batman Forever, which led to Keaton vacating the role of Batman.

==Plot== The Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the leader of the Red Triangle Circus Gang, who appear in Gotham City during the annual Christmas tree-lighting ceremony and cause a riot. As the police and Batman (Michael Keaton) deal with the riot, one of the guests at the ceremony, a businessman named Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), is kidnapped and taken to Penguin, who desires to become a citizen of Gotham and blackmails Shreck into helping him by threatening to expose evidence of his corporate crimes. 

Meanwhile, Shrecks secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), has learnt of her employers plan to build a power plant which will drain Gotham of its electricity. When Shreck confronts her after returning from his visit with Penguin, he pushes her out of a window to her death, and a flock of alley cats lick her corpse, reviving her. Selina returns home, suffers a mental breakdown, and designs a black vinyl catsuit to become the costumed vigilante Catwoman.

Penguin sends one of his costumed henchmen to kidnap the mayors baby while he "saves" him, becoming a hero to the people of Gotham. However, Batman is suspicious of Penguins true motives. After some time in the Hall of Records, Penguin discovers that his parents are dead and his name is Oswald Cobblepot, though he has secretly been taking notes on the first-born sons that live in Gotham City. Meanwhile, Batmans alter-ego, billionaire Bruce Wayne, is dealing with Shrecks persistence in having his new power plant built. As both Bruce and the current mayor will not approve of the power plant, Shreck decides to pull strings and make Penguin the new mayor. To do this, Penguin has the Red Triangle Gang create a riot, causing the citizens to lose all faith in the mayor. During the riot, Catwoman vandalizes Maxs Department Store to gain revenge on him. When Batman and Penguin confront each other, she intervenes just as the store blows up and slips away. Penguin escapes as Catwoman fights Batman and gets pushed off a rooftop, but she is saved when she lands in a dump-truck filled with kitty litter.

Penguin and Catwoman meet and collaborate on a plan to kill Batman out of mutual hatred for the Caped Crusader, but Selina finds herself developing a romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne as the two of them start to spend time together. That night, the Ice Princess, an actress chosen to turn on the Gotham City Christmas tree lights, is kidnapped by Penguin and a Batarang (which one of his henchmen took from a prior fight) is found in her dressing room, framing Batman for the crime. After a fight with Catwoman, Batman finds the Ice Princess on a rooftop where the Penguin releases a swarm of flying bats and makes her fall to her death, further incriminating Batman. As he escapes to the Batmobile, Batman discovers that Penguin has control over it due to a device that his gang installed. The Penguin takes it on a devastating rampage, but Batman regains control over it and escapes death.

The next day, Penguin and Shreck are using Batmans rampage to push for an impeachment of the mayor. Batman, having recorded the Penguins demeaning attitude of Gothams people during the rampage, plays it during the speech, turning the people and Shreck against him. Enraged, Penguin takes his notes from the Hall of Records and orders the Red Triangle Gang to kidnap all the first-born sons of Gotham so that he can throw them to their deaths in the sewer like his own parents did to him, and he personally kidnaps Max Shreck as revenge for being manipulated. Batman saves all the children, forcing the Penguin to execute an alternate plan to destroy the entire city with his army of rocket-armed penguin commandos. However, Batman foils the plan by luring the penguins back to the Penguins sewer base before confronting Penguin directly and knocking him into the sewer water from a great height.

Catwoman appears and again tries to kill Shreck, but Batman stops her and reveals himself as Bruce Wayne, and she does the same as Selina. This distracts her long enough for Shreck to draw a gun and shoot her four times. She survives all the shots and puts an electrical taser between their lips while grabbing an electrical cable, causing a tremendous explosion that kills Shreck but leaves no trace of Selina. As the dust settles, Penguin rises from the water and tries one more time to kill Batman, but fails and dies from his internal bleeding. The emperor penguins hold a funeral for their former master and drag his corpse into the sewer water, his resting place.
 Alfred (Michael Gough) drives Bruce home, but Bruce spots a shadow in the alley and has the car stopped so he can check. All he finds is a black cat trying to keep warm, and so Bruce takes her with him as he exchanges Christmas wishes with Alfred. As they leave, the Batsignal lights up in the night sky as Catwoman watches from afar.

==Production==

===Development=== Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. 
 Daniel Waters the 1960s TV series episodes "Hizzoner the Penguin" and "Dizzoner the Penguin". Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). "Three Go Mad in Gotham", Empire (film magazine)|Empire, pp. 39—46. Retrieved August 14, 2008.  Waters wrote a total of five drafts.   

On the characterization of Catwoman, Waters explained "Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary."     Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu. 

===Pre-production=== Batman & Robin appeared third film!"  Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment. 
 The Grifters, but she dropped out due to pregnancy.   Raquel Welch, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna, Ellen Barkin, Cher, Bridget Fonda and Susan Sarandon were then in competition for the role.   Sean Young, who was originally chosen for Vicki Vale in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition.  Burton was unfamiliar with Michelle Pfeiffers work, but was convinced to cast her after one meeting.    Pfeiffer received a $3 million salary, $2 million more than Bening, and a percentage of the box office.  The actress undertook kickboxing lessons for the role.  Kathy Long served as Pfeiffers body double. On Danny DeVitos casting, Waters explained, "I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin. We didnt really officially cast it, but for a short nasty little guy, its a short list. I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito." 

===Filming===
  Square set built inside Studio 16 on Warner Bros. Studios.]]
In early 1991, two of Hollywoods largest sound stages (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at Universal Studios) were being prepared for the filming of Batman Returns.  Filming started in June 1991.  Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on Rockefeller Center. Universals Stage 12 housed Penguins underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used.  Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable.  Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used, over 50% of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets. 

Animal rights groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs. Richard Hill, the curator of the penguins, explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable.  "On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees", recalls Hill. "In Hollywood, they were given a refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks. Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees." Owain Yolland (August 1992). "Two minutes, Mr Penguin", Empire (film magazine)|Empire, pp. 89—90. Retrieved August 14, 2008. 
 fake working title Dictel to go anywhere near the sets.  Kevin Costner was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a private investigator to track down the accomplice.  $65 million was spent during the production of Batman Returns, while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million.  The final shot of Catwoman looking at the Bat-Signal was completed during post-production and was not part of the shooting script. After Batman Returns was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a body double was chosen. 

===Design and effects=== iron maiden was used for Bruce Waynes entry into the Batcave.  Stan Winston, who worked with Burton on Edward Scissorhands, designed Danny DeVitos prosthetic makeup, which took two hours to apply. Brian D. Johnson (June 22, 1992). "Batmans Return", Macleans. Retrieved August 14, 2008.  DeVito had to put a combination of mouthwash and red/green food coloring in his mouth "to create a grotesque texture of some weird ooze." 

 
More than 60 Catsuits were designed in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each.  The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman (1989 film)|Batman. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it easy for him to get into character. J. P. Morgans wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shrecks costume design.

===Critical reception===
Batman Returns has received a favourable critical reception. Based on 67 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of critics enjoyed the film, with an average rating of 6.7/10. Much of the critics gave praise toward Tim Burtons visual style, accompanied by production designer Bo Welch, as well as the casting of Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken in supporting roles to compliment Keatons portrayal of Batman. 
 Daniel Waterss screenplay as "sharp." 
 Joker and even quicker with the quips." 

 -like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owners inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a Batman movie. But Returns comes closer than ever to Bob Kanes dark, original strip, which began in 1939." He described Walken as "engaging", DeVito as "exquisite" and Pfeiffer as "deliciously purry." 

Todd McCarthy in Variety (magazine)|Variety wrote that "the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burtons ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but the result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses." He praised the contributions of Stan Winston, Danny Elfman, Bo Welch and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that "the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains", calling DeVito "fascinating" and Pfeiffer "very tasty." 

Conversely,   dont go together; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes." He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role."    gave the film a B-; he wrote that "Burton still hasnt figured out how to tell a coherent story: Hes more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, theres more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." 

A "parental backlash" criticized Batman Returns with violence and sexual references that were unsuitable for children. McDonalds shut down their Happy Meal promotion for the film.  Burton responded, "I like Batman Returns better than the first one. There was this big backlash that it was too dark, but I found this movie much less dark."

===Legacy===
 

Batman Returns was the last film in the Batman in film|Batman film series that featured Tim Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor, respectively. With the following film, Batman Forever, Warner Bros. decided to go in a "lighter" direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film. Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer and approved of Joel Schumacher as director.    With Warner Bros. moving on development for Batman Forever in June 1993, a Catwoman Spin-off (media)|spin-off was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in Forever because of "her own little movie". 
 Daniel Waters also returned to the Catwoman spin-off with Burton.  In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct Catwoman or an adaptation of The Fall of the House of Usher.  On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, "turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that its the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script."  The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer getting replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (film)|Catwoman (2004) starring Halle Berry.
