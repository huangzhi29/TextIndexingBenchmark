Batman was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. It was the fifth-highest grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several  , paving the way for the DC animated universe, and has influenced Hollywoods modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre.

==Plot== James Gordon (Pat Hingle) to increase police activity and combat crime in preparation for the citys bicentennial. Reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) begin to investigate reports of a vigilante nicknamed "Batman", who is targeting the citys criminals.

Bruce meets with Vicki at her apartment, prepared to tell her that he is Batman. They are interrupted by the Joker, who asks Bruce, "Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?" before shooting him. Bruce, who was wearing body armor, escapes, and recollects that the young mugger who killed his parents said the same statement; he realizes that the mugger was none other than the Joker himself. Vicki suddenly appears in the Batcave, having been let in by Bruces butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough). After avouching himself to Vicki, Bruce—as Batman—leaves to destroy the Axis Chemical plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the townspeople to a nighttime parade with a promise to give away $20 million in cash. When the citizens arrive, however, he attacks them with Smilex gas, spewing it from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives on the scene and saves Gotham City from the attack using the Batplane|Batwing, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral.

Batman pursues the two, and at the top of the dusty edifice, he and the Joker confront each other in single combat.

Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again.

==Themes==
  theme of Batman, director Tim Burton explained, "the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. Its a fight between two disturbed people", adding that "The Joker is such a great character because theres a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because youre not bound by the laws of society".   

Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world.  Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an antihero. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker.  Kim Newman theorized that "Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent".

==Production==

===Development===
 
 pitching Batman campy Batman 1960s TV series. Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film.   

A disappointed Uslan then wrote a script titled Return of the Batman to give the film industry a better idea of his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of  , which his script pre-dated by six years.  In November 1979, producers    Though no movie studios were yet involved, the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Warner Bros. decided to accept Batman.   
 James Gordon, the Penguin who Mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature.  Holden died in 1981 and Niven in 1983, so this would never come to pass. A number of filmmakers were attached to Mankiewicz script, including Ivan Reitman and Joe Dante. Reitman wanted to cast Bill Murray as Batman and Eddie Murphy as Robin.    Nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers. Most of them were based on Strange Apparitions. However it was Mankiewiczs script that was still being used to guide the project.   

After the financial success of   and   rekindled Warner Bros. interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke.  Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of Steve Englehart to write a new treatment in March 1986.    It included the Joker and Rupert Thorne as the main villains, with a cameo appearance by the Penguin (comics)|Penguin. Silver St. Cloud and Dick Grayson were key supporting roles. It followed the similar storyline from Engleharts own Strange Apparitions (ISBN 1-56389-500-5). Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986. 

Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay.    Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that "unlocking the mystery" would become part of the storyline.    He reasoned, "You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman."    Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character.  One scene in Hamms script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Waynes parents. When Hamms script was rewritten, the scene was deleted but retaken to Batman Begins. 
 bootlegged at greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burtons Beetlejuice (1988).  When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction Batman was going in.     Hamm explained, "they hear Tim Burtons name and they think of Pee-wees Big Adventure. They hear Keatons name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of Batman, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didnt believe us."  To combat negative reports on the films production, Kane was hired as creative consultant.   

===Casting=== Something Wild, but Liotta declined, a decision he regrets.  Burton was also pressured by the studio to cast an obvious action movie star.  Producer Jon Peters favored Keaton, arguing he had the right "edgy, tormented quality." Having directed Keaton in Beetlejuice, Burton agreed.

 The Witches of Eastwick.  Nicholson had what was known as an "off-the-clock" agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming,  as well as being off for Los Angeles Lakers home games.    Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days.  He received a $6 million salary, as well as a large percentage of the box office gross estimated at $60 million to $90 million.

===Filming===
  served as the Wayne Manor.]]
The filmmakers considered filming Batman entirely on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at Pinewood Studios in England from October 1988 to January 1989.  18 sound stages were used, almost the entirety of Pinewoods 95-acre backlot.  Locations included Knebworth House and Hatfield House doubling for Wayne Manor, plus Acton Lane Power Station and Little Barford Power Station. Hanke, p.87-96   The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million.  Filming was highly secretive. The unit publicist was offered and refused pound sterling|£10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes worth) were stolen.    With various problems during filming, Burton called it "torture. The worst period of my life!" 

Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.  Jonathan Gems, Warren Skaaren and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming.  Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros.  Burton explained, "I dont understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work."  Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot.  Bob Kane supported this decision. 

Keaton, who called himself a "logic freak", was concerned that Batmans secret identity would in reality be fairly easy to uncover, and discussed ideas with Burton to better disguise the character, including the use of contact lenses.    Ultimately, Keaton decided to perform Batmans voice at a lower register than when he was portraying Bruce Wayne, which became a hallmark of the film version of the character, with Christian Bale later using the same technique. 

Originally in the climax, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a   model of the cathedral.  This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going? Well talk about it when you get to the top! I had to tell him that I didnt know."   

===Design===
  High Spirits, a choice he later regretted.  Furst enjoyed working with Burton. "I dont think Ive ever felt so naturally in tune with a director", he said; "Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at."

 Nike product placement with the Batsuit.  Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000.  Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit.  Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating.  Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholsons chalk-white face. Part of Nicholsons contract was approval over the makeup designer. 

===Music===
  Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jacksons songs together for the entire film score. 

Burton protested the ideas, citing "my movies arent commercial like  , also composed by Shirley Walker. 

==Marketing== Conan the Barbarian-type font".  Jon Peters unified all the films tie-ins, even turning down $6 million from General Motors to build the Batmobile because the car company would not relinquish creative control. 
 rebooted Batman Begins, albeit as an alias for the more notable Ras al Ghul. 

In the months pre-dating Batman s release in June 1989, a   published a novelization, Batman (1989 novel)|Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner.  It remained on the The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989.  Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed "it is less movie than a corporate behemoth".   

==Reception==

===Box office=== film based The Dark Knight.  The films gross is the 66th highest ever in North American ranks.  Although Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade made the most money worldwide in 1989,  Batman was able to beat The Last Crusade in North America,  and made a further $150 million in home video sales.

===Critical reaction===
Batman was criticized in some quarters for being too dark and too violent, but nonetheless received positive reviews.  Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime.  Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering   

The songs written by Prince were criticized for being "too out of place".  While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film.  On the film, Burton remarked, "I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. Its OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie."  Nonetheless, it received acclaim. Based on 67 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 72% of reviewers reacted positively to Batman.  Metacritic gives an aggregated score of 66, based on 17 reviews, indicating "generally favorable". 

Comics fans reacted negatively to the casting of Keaton as Batman, though they were appeased upon watching the film and seeing his performance.   James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, "the best thing that can be said about Batman is that it led to Batman Returns, which was a far superior effort."  Variety (magazine)|Variety felt "Jack Nicholson stole every scene" but still greeted the film with positive feedback.  Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed "Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you cant care much about." He also called the film "a depressing experience".  His reviewing partner Gene Siskel disagreed, describing the film as having a refreshingly adult approach with performances, direction and set design that draws you into a psychological world. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called it "watchable enough". 

===Legacy=== Peter Young Golden Globe Production Design, Visual Effects, Costume Design, Sound and Actor in a Supporting Role for Nicholson), but it won none of the categories.  Nicholson, Basinger, the make-up department and costume designer Bob Ringwood all received nominations at the Saturn Awards. The film was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film  and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. 

The success of Batman prompted  , as a result beginning the long-running DC animated universe  and helped establish the modern day superhero film genre. Series co-creator Bruce Timm stated the television shows Art Deco design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, "our show would never have gotten made if it hadnt been for that first Batman movie."  Burton joked, "ever since I did Batman, it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess Im the one responsible for that trend."   
 Batman & Robin (1997); the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney, respectively. 
 Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be "the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of Batman and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of Batman."  A superior court judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of Batman have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have "not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless."  Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melnikers attorney as "two popcorns and two Coca-Cola|Cokes".
