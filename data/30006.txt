 Brooke Smith).  Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them find Buffalo Bill and rescue Catherine.  Instead, Lecter demands a quid pro quo from Starling, offering clues about Buffalo Bill in exchange for personal information. Starling tells Lecter about the murder of her father when she was ten years old. Chilton secretly records the conversation and reveals Starlings deceit before offering Lecter a deal of Chiltons own making.  Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, Tennessee, where he verbally torments Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker) and gives her misleading information on Buffalo Bill including the name "Louis Friend".
 spring lambs being slaughtered on a relatives farm in Montana.  Starling admits that she still sometimes wakes thinking she can hear lambs screaming, and Lecter speculates that she is motivated to save Catherine in the hope that it will end the nightmares.  Lecter gives her back the case files on Buffalo Bill after their conversation is interrupted by Chilton and the police who escort her from the building.  Later that evening, Lecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell and disappears.

Starling analyzes Lecters annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim personally.  Starling travels to the victims hometown and discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor, with dresses and dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims.  She telephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to fashion a "woman suit" of real skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecters notes with hospital archives and finding a man named Jame Gumb, who once applied unsuccessfully for a Sex reassignment surgery|sex-change operation.  Starling continues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bills first victim in Ohio while Crawford leads an F.B.I. tactical team to Gumbs address in Illinois.  The house in Illinois is empty, and Starling is led to the house of "Jack Gordon", who she realizes is actually Jame Gumb, again by finding a sphinx moth. She pursues him into his multi-room basement, where she discovers that Catherine is still alive, but trapped in a dry well.  After turning off the basement lights, Gumb stalks Starling in the dark with Night vision device|night-vision goggles but gives his position away when he cocks his revolver. Starling turns around just in time and kills him, firing the whole magazine of her pistol onto him.

Some time later at her FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in Bimini.  He assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the favor, which she says she cannot do.  Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying that he is "having an old friend for dinner" and starts following a newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.

==Production==

===Development=== novel of the same name and is the second film to feature the character Hannibal Lecter following the 1986 film Manhunter (film)|Manhunter. Prior to the novels release, Orion Pictures partnered with Gene Hackman to bring the novel to the big screen. With Hackman set to direct and possibly star in the role of Lecter, negotiations were made to split the $500,000 cost of rights between Hackman and the studio.  In addition to securing the rights to the novel, producers also had to acquire the rights to the name "Hannibal Lecter", which were owned by Manhunter producer Dino De Laurentiis. Owing to the financial failure of the earlier film, De Laurentiis lent the character rights to Orion Pictures for free. 

In November 1987, Ted Tally was brought on to write the adaptation;  Tally had previously crossed paths with Harris many times, with his interest in adapting The Silence of the Lambs originating from receiving an advanced copy of the book from Harris himself.  When Tally was about halfway through with the first draft, Hackman withdrew from the project and financing fell through. However, Orion Pictures co-founder Mike Medavoy assured Tally to keep writing as the studio itself took care of financing and searched for a replacement director.  As a result, Orion Pictures sought director Jonathan Demme to helm the project. With the screenplay not yet completed, Demme signed on after reading the novel.  From there, the project quickly took off, as Tally explained, "  read my first draft not long after it was finished, and we met, then I was just startled by the speed of things. We met in May 1989 and were shooting in November. I dont remember any big revisions." 

===Casting=== The Accused, Demme was not convinced that she was right for the part.   Having previously collaborated on Married to the Mob, Demmes first choice for the role of Starling was Michelle Pfeiffer, who turned it down, later saying, "It was a difficult decision, but I got nervous about the subject matter". The Barbara Walters Special, American Broadcast Company, 1992  As a result, Foster was awarded the role due to her passion towards the character. 
 The Elephant Man.  Other actors considered for the role included Derek Jacobi and Daniel Day-Lewis. 
 Jack Crawford, FBI in Quantico, Virginia. To prepare for the role, Glenn met with John E. Douglas, whom the character is modeled after. Douglas gave Glenn a tour of the Quantico facility and also played for him an audio tape containing various recordings that serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris had made of themselves raping and torturing a 16-year-old girl.   According to Douglas, Glenn wept as he experienced the recordings and even changed his liberal stance on the death penalty. 

===Filming===
Principal photography for The Silence of the Lambs began on November 15, 1989 and concluded on March 1, 1990.  Filming primarily took place in and around Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with some scenes shot in nearby northern West Virginia.  The exterior of the Western Center near Canonsburg, Pennsylvania served as the setting for Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  In what was a rare act of cooperation at the time, the FBI allowed scenes to be filmed at the FBI Academy in Quantico; some FBI staff members even acted in bit parts.

 musical score for The Silence of the Lambs was composed by Howard Shore, who would also go on to collaborate with Demme on Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia. Recorded in Munich during the latter half of the summer of 1990, the score was performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra.  "I tried to write in a way that goes right into the fabric of the movie," explained Shore on his approach. "I tried to make the music just fit in. When you watch the movie you are not aware of the music. You get your feelings from all elements simultaneously, lighting, cinematography, costumes, acting, music. Jonathan Demme was very specific about the music." 

The tune played by the music box which Starling finds in the bedroom of Buffalo Bills first victim is taken from Mozarts opera The Magic Flute.  It is, ironically, the tune played by Papagenos magical bells, which charms his enemies and protects him from danger.

Ebert later added the film to his list of The Great Movies, recognizing the film as a "horror masterpiece" alongside such classics as Nosferatu, Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho, and Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween.

==Accusations of homophobia, transphobia and sexism== bisexual and Transsexualism|transsexual. In response to the critiques, Demme replied that Buffalo Bill "wasnt a gay character. He was a tormented man who hated himself and wished he was a woman because that would have made him as far away from himself as he possibly could be." Demme added that he "came to realize that there is a tremendous absence of positive gay characters in movies". 
 feminist and womens rights advocate Betty Friedan stated, "I thought it was absolutely outrageous that The Silence of the Lambs won four   Oscars.   Im not saying that the movie shouldnt have been shown. Im not denying the movie was an artistic triumph, but it was about the evisceration, the skinning alive of women. That is what I find offensive. Not the Playboy centerfold."
