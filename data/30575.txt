==Plot==
A deadly virus wipes out almost all of humanity in the years 1996 and 1997, forcing the survivors to live underground. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner living in a facility beneath Philadelphia circa 2027.  Cole is selected for "volunteer duty", where scientists train him and send him through time on a mission to collect information on the virus, thought to have been released by an organization known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. If he is successful at locating the virus, a scientist will be sent to study the original virus in the "past" and develop a cure in the "present".  Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a chase and an airport shooting.

Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested and hospitalized in a mental institution on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). There he encounters Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), a fellow mental patient with fanatical animal rights and anti-consumerist leanings. Cole tries unsuccessfully to leave a voicemail on a number monitored by the scientists in the future. After an escape attempt, Cole is locked in a cell, but disappears, returning to the future. Back in his own time, Cole is interviewed by the scientists, who play a distorted voice mail message which gives the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and asserts that they are responsible for the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists then send Cole back in time again, first to a French trench during World War I where he is shot in the leg and photographed before successfully being transported to 1996.
 Cassandra Complex. David Morse) questions her about mankinds sustainability on earth and points out that humanitys gradual destruction of the environment may be the real lunacy.  When Railly departs the event, Cole kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. They find and confront him; however, Goines denies any involvement with the virus and suggests that wiping out humanity was Coles idea in the asylum in 1990. When the police approach, Cole vanishes. Railly then finds evidence that Cole had been telling her the truth: she is told the bullet in his leg is dated to around 1920, and in the research material for her book she finds a photograph from World War I that features Cole.

Meanwhile, Cole convinces himself that his future experiences are hallucinations, and persuades the scientists to send him back again. Railly tries to settle the question of Coles sanity by leaving a voice mail on the number he provided, thereby creating the message the scientists had played right before they sent Cole on his second mission. Both Railly and Cole realize that the coming plague is real, and make plans to try to enjoy the time they have left.

On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the virus; the groups major act of protest is releasing animals from the zoo and placing Goines Nobel Prize-winning virologist father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are on the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose (Jon Seda), an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, an assistant at Goines fathers virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that matches the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks. After forcing his way through the checkpoint in pursuit of Peters, Cole is fatally shot by police. As Cole dies in Raillys arms, she makes eye contact with a small boy: the young James witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future. She draws Peters into a discussion about lunacy and the coming extinction of humanity.

==Production==

===Development=== pitch the Universal Pictures, remake rights David and Janet Peoples to write the screenplay.  Producer Charles Roven chose Terry Gilliam to direct because he believed the filmmakers style was perfect for 12 Monkeys  nonlinear storyline and time travel subplot.  Gilliam had just abandoned a film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities when he signed to direct 12 Monkeys.    The film also represents the second film for which Gilliam did not write or co-write the screenplay. Although he prefers to direct his own scripts, he was captivated by Peoples "intriguing and intelligent script. The story is disconcerting. It deals with time, madness and a perception of what the world is or isnt. It is a study of madness and dreams, of death and re-birth, set in a world coming apart." DVD production notes 

Universal took longer than expected to approve 12 Monkeys, although Gilliam had two stars (Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt) and a firm budget of $29.5&nbsp;million (low for a Hollywood science fiction film). Universals production of Waterworld (1995) had resulted in various cost overruns. To get 12 Monkeys approved for production, Gilliam persuaded Willis to lower his normal asking price. Christie, Gilliam, pp.226–230  Because of Universals strict production incentives and his history with the studio on Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil, Gilliam received final cut privilege. The Writers Guild of America was skeptical of the "inspired by" credit for La Jetée and Chris Marker. 

===Casting===
Gilliams initial casting choices were  s on each side of his neck.

Gilliam cast Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly because he was impressed by her performance in Blink (film)|Blink (1994).  The director first met Stowe when he was casting his abandoned film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities.  "She has this incredible ethereal beauty and shes incredibly intelligent", Gilliam said of Stowe. "Those two things rest very easily with her, and the film needed those elements because it has to be romantic." 

Gilliam originally believed that Pitt was not right for the role of Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise.  Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still relatively unknown at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys  release, however,   (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Seven (film)|Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple Universitys hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role. 

===Filming===
Filming for 12 Monkeys lasted from February 8 to May 6, 1995. Shooting on location in Philadelphia and Baltimore (including the Senator Theatre)   in winter was fraught with weather problems. There were also technical glitches with the futuristic mechanical props. Because the film has a nonlinear storyline, continuity errors occurred, and some scenes had to be reshot. Gilliam also injured himself when he went horseback riding. Despite setbacks, however, the director managed to stay within the budget and was only a week behind his shooting schedule. "It was a tough shoot", acknowledged Jeffrey Beecroft (Mr. Brooks, Dances with Wolves), the production designer. "There wasnt a lot of money or enough time. Terry is a perfectionist, but he was really adamant about not going over budget. He got crucified for The Adventures of Baron Munchausen|Munchausen, and that still haunts him."   

The filmmakers were not allowed the luxury of sound stages; thus, they had to find abandoned buildings or landmarks to use.

The exteriors of the climactic airport scene were shot at the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore-Washington International Airport, while the interior scenes were shot at the Pennsylvania Convention Center (formerly, Reading Terminal). Filming at the psychiatric hospital was done at the Eastern State Penitentiary. 

===Design===
Gilliam used the same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), including the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses).  The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists was based on the work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a "nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear. To me thats the world we live in, the way we communicate these days, through technical devices that pretend to be about communication but may not be."

===Allusions to other films and media===
12 Monkeys is inspired by the French short film La Jetée (1962); as in La Jetée, characters are haunted by the image of their own death. 

Like La Jetée, 12 Monkeys contains references to Alfred Hitchcocks Vertigo (film)|Vertigo (1958). Toward the end of the film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon and watch a scene from Vertigo. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy (Kim Novak) transformed herself into blonde Madeleine in Vertigo; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie (James Stewart) saw Judy emerge within a green light.  Brief notes of Bernard Herrmanns film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore in the first part of Vertigo. The scene at Muir Woods National Monument, where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in 12 Monkeys. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from Vertigo is repeated.  The Muir Woods scene in Vertigo is also re-enacted in La Jetée.

==Reception==

===Release=== From Dusk Black Sheep. 

Universal Studios Home Entertainments special edition of 12 Monkeys, released on May 10, 2005, contains an audio commentary by director Terry Gilliam and producer Charles Roven, The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys (a making-of documentary) and production notes.

A Blu-ray Disc of 12 Monkeys was released on July 28, 2009, and includes the same special features as the previous special edition DVD and HD DVD. 

===Critical reception===
Based on 59 reviews collected by   calculated a 74/100 rating, based on 20 reviews. 

Roger Ebert observed 12 Monkeys  depiction of the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. "This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, and the more you know about movies (especially the technical side), the more youre likely to admire it. And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses." 

Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised the art direction and set design. "Willis and Pittss performances, Gilliams atmospherics and an exhilarating momentum easily outweigh such trifling flaws in the script", Thomson reasoned.  Peter Travers from Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine cited the films success on Gilliams direction and Willis performance.  Internet reviewer James Berardinelli believed the filmmakers took an intelligent and creative motive for the time travel subplot. Rather than being sent to change the past, James Cole is instead observing it to make a better future.  Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|Time magazine felt the films time travel aspect and apocalyptic depiction of a bleaker future were clichés. "In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji (film)|Jumanji for adults", Corliss wrote. 

===Awards and nominations=== Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.  Terry Gilliam was honored for his directing duties at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. Christie, Gilliam, pp. 231–233  12 Monkeys received positive notices from the science fiction community. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation  and the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films awarded 12 Monkeys the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. Pitt and Weiss also won awards at the 22nd Saturn Awards. Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Gilliam and writers David and Janet Peoples received nominations. 

==Lebbeus Woods lawsuit==
In the beginning of the film, Cole is brought into the interrogation room and told to sit in a chair attached to a vertical rail on the wall. A sphere supported by a metal armature is suspended directly in front of him, probing for weaknesses as the inquisitors interrogate him.  Architect Lebbeus Woods filed a lawsuit against Universal in February 1996, claiming that his work "Neomechanical Tower (Upper) Chamber" was used without permission. Woods won his lawsuit, requiring Universal to remove the scenes, but he ultimately allowed their inclusion in exchange for a "high six-figure cash settlement" from Universal.    

==Trilogy claims== Brazil and Twelve Monkeys    ";  however, Gilliam was interviewed by Alex Suskind for Indiewire in late 2014, saying "Well, it’s funny, this trilogy was never something I ever said, but it’s been repeated so often it’s clearly true  . I don’t know who started it but once it started it never stopped".   

==TV adaptation==
 
 12 Monkeys pilot was Terra Nova. Due to the series being labeled as "cast contingent", the series did not move forward until the roles of Cole and Goines were cast.  In April 2014, Syfy green-lighted the first season, which will consist of 13 episodes, including the pilot filmed in 2013. The series premiered on January 16, 2015.  On March 12, 2015, the series was renewed for a second season that is slated to air in 2016.
