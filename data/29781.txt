The Texas Chain Saw Massacre  is a 1974 American slasher film, directed and produced by Tobe Hooper, who cowrote it with Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface, the main antagonist. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the eras political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.
 Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.

==Plot== paraplegic brother, a hitchhiker cuts himself the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them that the pumps are empty. 

They continue towards the homestead, intending to return to the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery. When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole and the couple head off to find it. They find the swimming-hole dried up but hear a generator running in the distance. They stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk calls out, asking for gas, while Pam waits on a swing in the yard. After Kirk receives no answer, he enters through the unlocked door, whereupon Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) appears and kills him with a mallet. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, and make her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He finds the couples blanket outside the nearby house. He investigates and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him and stuffs Pam back into the freezer.

With darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple in an upstairs room. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window and flees to the gas station. Leatherface disappears into the night. The proprietor calms her with offers of help, but then ties her up, gags her and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving at the same time as the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherfaces brother. When the pair bring Sally inside, the hitchhiker recognizes her and taunts her.
 Grandpa (John Dugan), from upstairs to share the meal. During the night they decide that Grandpa (the best killer in the old slaughterhouse) should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer, but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and escapes to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run down and killed by a passing semi-trailer truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help. The driver hits him in the face with a large wrench. Sally escapes in the back of a passing pickup truck as Leatherface waves the chainsaw above his head in frustration.

{{Quote box quote = I definitely studied Gein&nbsp;... but I also noticed a murder case in Houston at the time, a serial murderer you probably remember named Elmer Wayne Henley.

Well, that struck me as interesting, that he had this conventional morality at that point. He wanted it known that, now that he was caught, he would do the right thing.

Hooper has cited changes in the cultural and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the "film you are about to see is true", was a response to being "lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world", including Watergate scandal|Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War".  The "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film".  The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper while he was in the hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.

===Casting===
 
Many of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow.    Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there.  Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center.  Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman.  For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members costumes. 

Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was selected for the role of Leatherface.    He regarded Leatherface as being mentally retarded and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke.   John Larroquette briefly served as narrator in the opening credits.

The small budget and concerns over high-cost equipment rentals meant the crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was humid   and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110&nbsp;°Fahrenheit|F&nbsp;(43&nbsp;°C) on July&nbsp;26.  Hansen later recalled, "It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldnt wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didnt have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that   12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month."

Most of the filming took place in the farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin.    The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse.  Art director Robert Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.

On August&nbsp;28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston agreed to distribute the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 and 35&nbsp;percent of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, "We made a deal with the devil,  , and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved."  They signed the contract with Bryanston and after the investors recouped their money (with interest)—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members.  Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000, but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.

Hooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a "PG" rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore.    Instead, it was originally rated "X". After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an "R" rating. A distributor apparently restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an "R".  In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust  and, in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges. 
 Bowen 2004, p. 18  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman.     While the British ban was in force the word "chainsaw" itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films.  In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license.  The following year the BBFC passed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for release with an 18 certificate (indicating that it should not be seen or purchased by a person under 18),  and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4.

Observing that it managed to be "horrifying without being a bloodbath (youll see more gore in a   praised the films "subtle touches"—such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas—and said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.

===Cultural impact===
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is considered one of the greatest—and most controversial—of horror films,   and a major influence on the genre.   In 1999 Richard Zoglin of   praised the film as "...an exquisite work of art" and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence. 
 Freddy and Jason and his hockey mask."  Don Sumner called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers.  According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of Entertainment Weekly, it laid the foundations for future horror franchises such as Halloween (franchise)|Halloween, The Evil Dead, and The Blair Witch Project.    Ridley Scott cited it as an inspiration for his 1979 film Alien (film)|Alien.   French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career.  Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his art, most notably his 2003 film House of 1000 Corpses. 
 Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France.  Entertainment Weekly ranked the film sixth on its 2003 list of "The Top 50 Cult Films".    In a 2005 Total Film poll, it was selected as the greatest horror film of all time.     It was named among Time (magazine)|Time magazines top 25 horror films in 2007.  In 2008 the film ranked number 199 on Empire (magazine)|Empire magazines list of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time".  Empire also ranked it 46th in its list of the 50 greatest independent films.  In a 2010 Total Film poll, it was again selected as the greatest horror film; the judging panel included veteran horror directors such as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and George A. Romero.  In 2010, as well, The Guardian ranked it number 14 on its list of the top 25 horror films.  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame in 1990, with director Hooper accepting the award,  and it is part of the permanent collection of New York Citys Museum of Modern Art.  In 2012, the film was named by critics in the British Film Institutes Sight & Sound magazine as one of the 250 greatest films. 

==Themes and analysis== critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence.   Stephen Prince comments that the horror is "born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms&nbsp;... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth."  As with many horror films, it focuses on the "final girl" trope—the heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters:     Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver.  Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters.    The specific case of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered—hung on a meathook—and the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture.    In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film.    She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves. 

In one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women.  On first viewing The Texas Chain Saw Massacre they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable.  Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students.    One male participant described the screaming, especially Sallys, as the "most freaky thing" in the film. 

According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining.    Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.

 The Birds&nbsp;(1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses "about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process",  concerns amplified during the 1970s by the "delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate scandal|Watergate".  "If Psycho began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic", he writes, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcocks film while refusing comforting closure". 

Robin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances.  He states that the picture "brings to focus a spirit of negativity&nbsp;... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness".  Naomi Merritt explores the films representation of "cannibalistic capitalism" in relation to Georges Batailles theory of taboo and transgression.  She elaborates on Woods analysis, stating that the Sawyer familys values "reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions&nbsp;... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive." 

In Kim Newmans view, Hoopers presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager.  Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing, states, "The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody&nbsp;... this delicate balance is struck in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other." 

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has also been described as "the ultimate pro-vegetarian film" due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans being slaughtered for meat, putting humans in the position of being slaughtered like farm animals. Director Tobe Hooper gave up meat while making the film, and said "In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; it’s about the chain of life and killing sentient beings."

After the retirement of BBFC chief Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut on video (as well as film) with an 18 certificate, almost 25&nbsp;years after the original release.  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States,  and in May 2000 in the United Kingdom.  An initial Australian DVD release in 2001 was followed by a revised version six years later.  Dark Sky Films released a two-disc "ultimate" edition,    featuring several interviews, restored audio and picture quality, and other extras including deleted scenes.  Dark Sky Films released a Blu-ray version on September 30, 2008.  In March 2014, Dark Sky announced the film had received a 4k restoration, and will be re-released in June 2014 to celebrate the films 40th anniversary.  The 4k restoration version is scheduled to be screened in the Directors Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.   

Shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on home video in 1982, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600.    In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls.  As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.  

The film was followed by two sequels, a remake, a film that straddles both those categories, and a prequel. The first sequel,  &nbsp;(1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film,  , starring  , in 2006. A seventh film, Texas Chainsaw 3D, was released on January 4, 2013.  It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the 2003 or 2006 films.
