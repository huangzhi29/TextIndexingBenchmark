}} science fiction Godzilla series, the film is a belated sequel to The Return of Godzilla from 5 years earlier. This was the first "monster vs monster" film from this rebooted series. It featured a new monster called Biollante, with producer Tomoyuki Tanaka desiring new monster opponents for Godzilla rather than using characters from the original films. As part of pre-release publicity, Tanaka solicited script ideas from the public with 5,000 entries being received. The winning entry that was selected was from Shinichiro Kobayashi, a dentist and occasional science fiction writer. Director Ōmori then adapted it into the films script.

The film was released direct to video in the United States in November 25, 1992 by HBO Video.

This work was selected as the best Godzilla film, based on a vote by fans and judges, on Nihon Eiga Satellite Broadcasting, in July 19, 2014. 

==Plot==
In the aftermath of The Return of Godzilla|Godzillas attack on Tokyo and his subsequent imprisonment at Mt. Mihara, a team of scientists discovers cells left in the rubble by the monster and collects them. A group of American militants takes a sample of their own. They attempt to escape with them, but are killed by a lone assassin codenamed SSS9, who steals the sample and departs. He boards a cruise liner and heads to the Republic of Saradia to deliver the cells to the Saradia Institute of Technology and Science. The president of the institute wants to use the cells to merge with genetically-modified plants, hoping to transform Saradias deserts to vast greenery and end the countrys dependence on oil wells for wealth. Dr. Genshiro Shiragami and his daughter, Erika, are enlisted to aid with the ambitious project. However, a terrorist bombing destroys the institutes laboratory, ruining the cells and killing Erika.

Five years later, Shiragami has returned to Japan and has merged some of Erikas cells with those of a rose. He hopes to have Erikas soul continue living in the plant. Psychic Miki Saegusa, who heads an institution for intuitive children, aids him in his research. The JSDF are using the Godzilla cells they collected to create "Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria", hoping it can serve as a fatal weapon against Godzilla should he return. Scientist Kazuhito Kirishima and Lt. Goro Gondo are assigned to lead the project. They attempt to recruit Shiragami to aid them, but a mournful Shiragami declines. International tensions are increasing over the Godzilla cells: an American biological corporation called Bio-Major wants the cells for its own personal gains, as does the Saradia Institute of Technology and Science. Bio-Major sends two agents to Japan, while Saradia sends SSS9. An explosion from Mt. Mihara causes tremors across the area, including Shiragamis home. The roses are badly damaged, and Shiragami realizes he needs a drastic plan to save Erikas soul. He agrees to join the JSDFs effort, giving him access to the Godzilla cells. He merges them with the roses at his lab. A night later, Bio-Major breaks into Shiragamis lab to steal the cells, but are ambushed by SSS9. A large, tentacle-like vine emerges and attacks the trio, killing a Bio-Major agent before the other two escape. The creature escapes to a nearby lake, transforming to a giant plant-like being that Shiragami names "Biollante."

The Bio-Major agent, in a desperate attempt to procure the cells, plants explosives around Mt. Mihara and issues an ultimatum to the Diet of Japan, warning that if he does not get the cells, he will detonate the explosives and free Godzilla. Kirishima and Gondo attempt to trade, but SSS9 thwarts the attempt and runs off with the cells. The explosives go off, and Godzilla escapes. He attempts to reach the nearest power plant to replenish his supply of nuclear energy, but Biollante calls out to him. Godzilla arrives at the lake to engage Biollante in a vicious battle, and emerges as the victor. Godzilla proceeds toward the power plant at Tsuruga, but Miki uses her psychic powers to divert him toward Osaka instead. The city is quickly evacuated, and a team of militants, led by Gondo, meet Godzilla at the central district and fire rockets infused with the anti-nuclear bacteria into his body. Gondo is killed in the process, and an unaffected Godzilla leaves the city.

Kirishima recovers the cells and returns them to the JSDF. Shiragami theorizes that if Godzillas body temperature is increased, the bacteria should work against him. The JSDF forms microwave-emitting plates during an artificial thunderstorm, hitting Godzilla with lightning and heating up his body temperature during a battle in the mountains outside Osaka. Godzilla is only moderately affected, but Biollante arrives to engage him in battle once again. The fight ends after Godzilla fires his atomic heat ray inside Biollantes mouth. An exhausted Godzilla collapses on the beach, and Biollante disintegrates and her spores float to the sky, forming an image of Erika amongst the stars. Shiragami, watching the scene, is shot dead by SSS9. Kirishima chases the assassin and, after a brief scuffle, SSS9 is killed by a microwave-emitting plate. Godzilla reawakens and leaves for the ocean.

==English version== international version of the film was released on video in the United States by HBO Video in 1992. The film was released on laserdisc the next year. Godzilla vs. Biollante was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in America by Echo Bridge Entertainment through Miramax on December 4, 2012.

==English version development==
In Early 1990, Toho entered discussions with Miramax to distribute the film. When talks broke off, Toho filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Federal Court, accusing Miramax of entering an oral agreement in June to pay Toho $500,000 to distribute the film. This lawsuit delayed the films release for two years. An out of court settlement was reached with Miramax buying the rights to the film for an unreported figure. While Miramax had entertained thoughts of releasing the film in theaters, but in the end it was decided to release the film straight to home video instead. HBO released the film on VHS in 1992 and Laserdisc in 1993. Miramax utilized the uncut English international version of the film for this release. 

==Reception==

===Box office===
In Japan, the film sold approximately 2 million tickets, earning $7,000,000 (U.S).

===Critical reaction===
Godzilla vs. Biollante has received very positive reviews, with praise for the story, music and visuals.
Ed Godziszewski of Monster Zero said the film is "by no means a classic" but felt that "for the first time in well over 20 years, a   script is presented with some fresh, original ideas and themes."  Joseph Savitski of Beyond Hollywood said the films music is "a major detraction", but added that its "not only one of the most imaginative films in the series, but also the most enjoyable to watch."  Japan Hero said, " his is definitely a Godzilla movie not to be missed." 

===Influence===
Godzilla vs. Biollante is a turning point in the series. This work was highly regarded then, however, the box-office gross in Japan was less than the previous one, The Return of Godzilla (1984). Therefore, Toho makes a shift from a realistic science fiction line to a fantastic family entertainment featuring star monsters from previous years.
