They have four days to find it before the valley in which it is hidden will be flooded to create Arkabutla Lake as part of a new hydroelectric project.  Early in their escape, while still chained together, they try to jump onto a moving train, but are dragged off when Pete trips.  They then encounter a blind man  (Lee Weaver) traveling on a handcar.  They hitch a ride, and he tells their futures.  They "seek a great fortune" and they will "find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek".  They will also see many wonders on their journey, including a "cow on the roof of a cotton house".
 Tommy Johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar.  Tommy describes the devil as being "White, as white as you folks...with empty eyes and a big hollow voice.

He only mentioned it to persuade the other men (who were chained to him) to escape so he could reconcile with his wife, who wrote to him, telling him she would be getting remarried.

He gets on stage, dances, and endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys, granting them a full pardon; he then has them join in singing "You Are My Sunshine" while the event is played on the radio.  Penny accepts Everett back, but demands that he find her original ring if they are to be married.  As they leave the dinner, they run into a mob taking to jail a jubilant George, who happily claims he will be electrocuted.  Delmar comments, "Looks like George is right back on top again."

The next morning, the four men set out to retrieve the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley where Everett originally claimed to have hidden the treasure.  When they arrive, Cooley and his men arrest them and prepare to hang them.  Everett protests, stating they had been pardoned on the radio, but Sheriff Cooley ignores their pleas, responding that where he comes from, "they dont have a radio".  The three start to despair while Everett improvises a prayer to be saved.  Suddenly, the valley is flooded and they are saved from hanging while Sheriff Cooley, his dogs, and his men drown during the flood.  Using one of their coffins as a raft, Pete and Delmar jubilantly praise God, while Everett dismisses the incident as luck.  He pipes down though, as a cow floats by on top of a submerged cotton house. Tommy finds the ring in a desk on which he is floating, and they return to town.

Everett and Penny walk through town with their daughters in tow, singing.  Everett presents the ring to Penny, who promptly states that it is the wrong one and demands her ring back.  As Everett protests the futility of trying to find it at the bottom of the lake, the blind man rolls by on his railway handcar, his voice joining those of the girls in song.

* Holly Hunter as Penny Wharvey-McGill, Everetts ex-wife; a demanding woman, she is fed up with Everetts wheeling and dealing, and divorces him while he is in prison, telling their children that he was hit by a Louisville & Nashville train.

==Production==
The idea of O Brother, Where Art Thou? arose spontaneously. Work on the script began long before the start of production in December 1997, and was at least half-written by May 1998. Despite the fact that Ethan described the Odyssey as "one of my favorite storyline schemes" neither of the brothers had read the epic and were only familiar with its content through adaptations and numerous references to the Odyssey in popular culture.    According to the brothers, Nelson (who has a degree in classics from Brown University  ) was the only person on the set who had read the Odyssey.   

The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 Preston Sturges film Sullivans Travels, in which the protagonist (a director) wants to direct a film about the Great Depression called O Brother, Where Art Thou?  that will be a "commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, the problems that confront the average man". Lacking any experience in this area, the director sets out on a journey to experience the human suffering of the average man, but is sabotaged by his anxious studio. The film has some similarity in tone to Sturges film, including scenes with prison gangs and a black church choir. The prisoners at the picture show scene is also a direct homage to a nearly identical scene in Sturges film. 

Joel Coen revealed in a 2000 interview that he came to Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix, Arizona, to offer the lead role to Clooney. Clooney agreed to do the role immediately, without reading the script. He stated that he liked even the Coens least successful films. 

John Turturro, who plays Pete, had been a constant actor for the Coens. O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the fourth film of the brothers in which he has starred. Other actors in O Brother, Where Art Thou? who had worked previously with the Coens include John Goodman (three films), Holly Hunter (two), Michael Badalucco, and Charles Durning (in one film each).

One of the notable features of the film is its use of digital color correction to give the film a Sepia (color)|sepia-tinted look.  Filmed near locations in Canton, MS; Florence, SC; and Wardville, LA.
  Cinematographer Roger Deakins stated, "Ethan and Joel favored a dry, dusty Delta look with golden sunsets. They wanted it to look like an old hand-tinted picture, with the intensity of colors dictated by the scene and natural skin tones that were all shades of the rainbow." 

This was the fifth film collaboration between the Coen Brothers and Deakins, and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi at a time of year when the foliage, grass, trees, and bushes would be a lush green.    It was filmed near locations in Canton, Mississippi and Florence, South Carolina in the summer of 1999. {{cite web

 Southern U.S. political reform that defined Southern politics in the first half of the 20th century.

The Ku Klux Klan, at the time a political force of white populism, is depicted burning crosses and engaging in ceremonial dance. The character Menelaus "Pappy" ODaniel, the Governor of Mississippi and host of the radio show The Flour Hour, is similar in name and demeanor to W. Lee ODaniel|W.&nbsp;Lee "Pappy" ODaniel,  one-time Governor of Texas and later U.S. Senator from that state.    W.

In one campaign, W.&nbsp;Lee ODaniel carried a broom,     an oft-used campaign device in the reform era, promising to sweep away patronage and Political corruption|corruption.  His theme song had the hook, "Please pass the biscuits, Pappy", emphasizing his connection with flour. 
 James Houston "Jimmie" Davis   ) and Homer Stokes, as the challenger to the incumbent ODaniel, portrays himself as the "reform candidate", using a broom as a prop.

==Music==
 
Music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support. Noted producer and musician T-Bone Burnett worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases, and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced.  Burnett in turn consulted with famed Los Angeles music historian Alan Larman.

 CMA Award for Single of the Year  and a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, both for the song "Man of Constant Sorrow".  Tim Blake Nelson sang the lead vocal on "In the Jailhouse Now".   

"Man of Constant Sorrow" has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the music video, and two in the soundtrack album. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse.    Though the song received little significant radio airplay,    it reached #35 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 2002.    The version of "Ill Fly Away" heard in the film is performed not by Krauss and Welch (as it is on the CD and concert tour), but by the Kossoy Sisters with Erik Darling accompanying on long-neck five-string banjo, recorded in 1956 for the album Bowling Green on Tradition Records.   
 Tommy Johnson, who claimed to have sold his soul to the devil in return for blues fame.  The same connection can be made to Robert Johnson, who was also reputed to have sold his soul to the Devil at a crossroads in return for musical skills. This attribution is supported when the boys drop off Tommy at a crossroads, "Cross Road Blues" being a signature song of Robert Johnson.
