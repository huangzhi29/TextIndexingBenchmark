Princess Mononoke is set in the late Muromachi period (approximately 1336 to 1573) of Japan with fantasy elements. The story follows the young Emishi warrior Ashitakas involvement in a struggle between forest gods and the humans who consume its resources. The term   is not a name, but a Japanese word for a spirit or monster.

Princess Mononoke was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. It was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and the highest-grossing there of all time until Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic was released later that year. It was translated and distributed in North America by Miramax Films, and despite a poor box office performance there, it sold well on DVD and video, bringing Ghibli attention in the United States for the first time.

==Plot==
 
In Muromachi period Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills the demon before it reaches the village, but not before its corruption curses his right arm. The curse gives him superhuman fighting abilities, but will eventually kill him. The demon is revealed to be a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The villages wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago was exiled from.

Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jiko-bō, a wandering monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a Qilin|Kirin-like creature by day and a giant "Daidarabotchi|nightwalker" by night. Nearby, men are herding oxen to Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi, when they are attacked by a wolf clan led by the wolf goddess Moro. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Later, Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men, and sees San and her wolf clan; he greets them, but they ignore him and leave. He carries the injured men through the forest, where he encounters many Kodama (spirit)|kodama, and glimpses the Forest Spirit.

In Irontown, Ashitaka learns Eboshi has built the town by clear-cutting forests to reclaim ironsand and produce iron, leading to conflict with the forest gods. The town is a refuge for social outcasts, including former brothel workers and Leprosy in Japan|lepers, whom Eboshi employs to manufacture firearms to defend against the gods. Ashitaka also learns Eboshi is responsible for turning Nago into the demon. Eboshi explains that San, whom she calls Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves as one of their own, and deeply resents humankind.

San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious. As he leaves the town carrying San, he is shot by a villager, and falls unconscious while heading for the forest. San awakens and is about to kill the dying Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the mighty Forest Spirit saves his life.

Meanwhile, a clan of boars led by the blind boar god Okkoto attack Irontown to save the forest. Eboshi prepares for battle and sets out to kill the Forest Spirit. Jiko-bō, revealed to be a mercenary, intends to give the gods head to the Emperor of Japan in return for protection from local daimyo lords; according to legend, the severed head of the Forest Spirit grants immortality.

In the battle, Okkoto is corrupted by gunshot wounds. Disguising themselves in boar skins, Jiko-bōs men trick the rampaging Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San desperately tries to stop Okkoto, but is swept up in the corruption consuming her body. Moro attacks him and appeals to Ashitaka to use his love for San to save her. However, Ashitakas infection is accelerated and San is also cursed by the corruption.

Eboshi beheads the Forest Spirit during its transformation into the nightwalker; corruption pours from its body, killing all life it touches as it searches for its head, which Jiko-bō has stolen. The forest begins to decay while kodama die. Moro, dying from injuries sustained in the battle, uses the last of her strength to bite off Eboshis right arm. After bandaging Eboshi and convincing San to help him get the Forest Spirits head back, Ashitaka and San follow Jiko-bō to Irontown, where they manage to return the gods head. Restored, the Forest Spirit falls into the lake, healing the land, and cures Ashitaka and San of the curse.

Despite telling Ashitaka how much he means to her, San decides to remain in the forest due to her resentment of humankind. Ashitaka will help rebuild Irontown, but tells San he will visit her in the forest. In gratitude for Ashitakas efforts, Eboshi vows to rebuild a better town, and Jiko-bō decides to give up as he "cant win against fools." The forest begins to grow back.

==Cast==
* Yōji Matsuda voices  , the last prince of the Emishi tribe whose traveling companion is  , a  , more similar to a brown sable antelope than an elk. Miyazaki did not want Ashitaka to be a typical hero, saying that he is a "melancholic boy who has a fate" and also stated that Ashitakas curse "is similar to the lives of people  ".    Ashitakas English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as "an unexpected hero. He’s not your usual wild, brave guy. He’s really just a young, earnest man who’s trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village."

Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film.

He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperors authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she wouldnt hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams.  Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a shirabyōshi.

Driver viewed Eboshi as "a warrior, an innovator and a protector." 
 Kaoru Kobayashi provides the voice of  , a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a ninja, a member of a religious group or "a very good guy." He eventually decided to give Jigo elements of the above groups.  In the English version, Jiko-bō is voiced by Billy Bob Thornton.

* Masahiko Nishimura voices  , an ox driver; John DeMita voiced Kohroku in the English version.

 song of the same title. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of Princess Mononoke. In April 1995, supervising animator Masashi Ando devised the character designs from Miyazakis storyboard. In May 1995, Miyazaki drew the initial storyboards. That same month, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of Yakushima, of Kyushu, an inspiration for the landscape of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and the mountains of Shirakami-Sanchi in northern Honshu for location scouting along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days.  Animation production commenced in July 1995.  Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 cels in the film,  and is estimated to have redrawn parts of 80,000 of them.     The final storyboards of the films ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.

 computer animation digital paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films. Most of the film is colored with traditional paint, based on the color schemes designed by Miyazaki and Michiyo Yasuda. However, producers agreed on the installation of computers to successfully complete the film prior to the Japanese premiere date. 

Two titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as Princess Mononoke. The other title can be translated into English as either The Story of Ashitaka or The Legend of Ashitaka. In a Tokyo Broadcasting System program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Hayao Miyazaki had preferred The Legend of Ashitaka as the title while Suzuki himself favoured Princess Mononoke. Suzuki also mentioned that Miyazaki had created a new kanji to write his preferred title.    

The English dub contains minor additional voice overs to explain nuances of Japanese culture to western audiences. 
 

==Themes==
 
A central theme of Princess Mononoke is the Environment (biophysical)|environment.  The film centers on the adventure of Ashitaka as he journeys to the west to undo a fatal curse inflicted upon him by Nago, a boar turned into a demon by Eboshi.  Michelle J. Smith and Elizabeth Parsons said that the film  "makes heroes of outsiders in all identity politics categories and blurs the stereotypes that usually define such characters". In the case of the Deer gods destruction of the forest and Tataraba, Smith and Parsons said that the "supernatural forces of destruction are unleashed by humans greedily consuming natural resources".  They also characterized Eboshi as a business-woman who has a desire to make money at the expense of the forest, and also cite Eboshis intention to destroy the forest to mine the mountain "embodies environmentalist evil". 
 sexuality and disability. Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the University of Wyoming, and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Womens Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that "embraces modern social systems, such as industrialization, gendered division of labor, institutionalization of people with diseases, and militarization of men and women." They likened Lady Eboshi to a monarch.  Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshis disregard of ancient laws and curses towards prostitutes and lepers was an enlightenment reasoning and her exploit of using disability furthered her modernist viewpoints. 
 wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as Kikis Delivery Service, where he has been quoted as saying "It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that were happy?"

The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both anime fans and arthouse moviegoers in English-speaking countries. Miramax Films, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, purchased the films distribution rights for North America. Miyazaki met with Harvey Weinstein, Miramaxs chairman; Weinstein demanded that edits should be made to Princess Mononoke.  In response, Toshio Suzuki sent Weinstein a katana with a message stating "No cuts."   
 The Sandman. The main changes from the Japanese version are to provide a cultural context for phrases and actions which those outside of Asia may not be familiar with. Such alterations include references to mythology and specific names for groups, such as Jibashiri and Shishigami, that appear in the Japanese version, which are changed to more general terms, such as Mercenary and Forest Spirit, in the English version. The rationale for such changes is that the majority of non-Japanese viewers would not understand the mythological references and that the English language simply has no words for the Jibashiri, Shishigami and other terms.

Miramax chose to put a large sum of money into creating the English dub of Princess Mononoke with famous actors and actresses, yet when they released it in theatres there was little or no advertising and it was given a very limited run, showing in only a few theatres and for a very short time. Disney later complained about the fact that the movie did not do well at the box office. In September 2000, the film was announced for release on DVD in North America exclusively with the English dub. In response to fans requests to add the Japanese track as well as threats of poor sales, Miramax hired translators for the Japanese version. This plan delayed the DVD release back by almost three months, but it sold well when it was finally released.

In July 2000, Buena Vista Home Entertainment announced plans to release the film on VHS and DVD in North America on August 29.  Initially, the DVD version of Princess Mononoke did not include the Japanese-language track at the request of Buena Vistas Japan division, citing concerns that "a foreign-released DVD containing the Japanese language track will allow for the importation of such a DVD to Japan, which could seriously hurt the local sales of a future release of the  ".    The fansite Nausicaa.net organized an email campaign for fans to include the Japanese language track,  while DVD Talk began an online petition to retain the Japanese language track.  The DVD release of Princess Mononoke was delayed as a result.

Leonard Klady of Variety (magazine)|Variety said that Princess Mononoke "is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script" and the film "has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinemas most grand canvases."    Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke "a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year."    Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly called the film "a windswept pinnacle of its art" and that it "has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story."
