== Plot == King Edward Scotland following Brian Cox), slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.
 Prince Edward, Stirling and Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his sons wife, Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau), to try to negotiate with Wallace, hoping Wallace will kill her and thus draw the French king to declare war. Wallace refuses the bribe sent with Isabella by Longshanks, but after meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Meanwhile, Longshanks prepares an army to invade Scotland.

Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility that immediate action is needed to counter the threat and to take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay betray Wallace. The Scots lose the Battle of Falkirk|battle, and Morrison and Hamishs father die at the battle. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the kings lancers, who turns out to be Robert. Remorseful, Robert gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert, intending to join Wallace and commit troops to the war, sets up a meeting with him in Edinburgh. However, Roberts father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallaces child, and intent on ending Longshanks line and ruling in his sons place.

In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsmans valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, "Mercy", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitation|decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.

In 1314, Robert, now Scotlands king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallaces memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.

== Production ==
 ]]

Gibsons production company, Icon Productions, had difficulty raising enough money even if he were to star in the film. Warner Bros. was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another Lethal Weapon sequel, which he refused. Paramount Pictures only agreed to American and Canadian distribution of Braveheart after 20th Century Fox partnered for international rights.  The production budget has been estimated by IMDb at US$72 million.
 Ireland using Irish Army Reserve as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras, up to 1,600 in some scenes, portray both armies. The reservist had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb. 

According to Gibson, he was inspired by the big screen epics he had loved as a child, William Wylers The Big Country (1958) and Stanley Kubricks Spartacus (film)|Spartacus (1960). 

Braveheart was shot in the anamorphic format with Panavision C- and E-Series lenses. 

Gibson toned down the films battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA; the final version was rated R for "brutal medieval warfare". {{cite web| url = http://www.filmratings.com/ | title = Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA)

=== Cultural effects ===

  in the mid to late 1990s. 

=== Wallace Monument ===
  monumental mason from Brechin,    included the word "Braveheart" on Wallaces shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to "desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap".  In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statues face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as "among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland".  In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.   

== Historical inaccuracy ==

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harrys 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.    In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, "Is Blind Harry true? I dont know. I know that it spoke to my heart and thats what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart."   Blind Harrys poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallaces affair with Princess Isabelle).

Elizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which "almost totally   in Andalusia.  It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films. 

Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period "no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)." {{cite web

}}  Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not "in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film".  She compares the inaccuracy to "a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around."  "The events arent accurate, the dates arent accurate, the characters arent accurate, the names arent accurate, the clothes arent accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate." {{cite web

   The belted plaid (feileadh mór léine) was not introduced until the 16th century.   Peter Traquair has referred to Wallaces "farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."  Traquair, Peter Freedoms Sword, HarperCollins Publishers (1998) 
 John OFarrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a "Plasticine dog" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit. {{citation

Randall Wallace has defended his script from historians who have dismissed the film as a Hollywood perversion of actual events.   In the DVD audio commentary of Braveheart, Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more "cinematically compelling" than the historical fact or conventional mythos.

=== Jus primae noctis === Edward Longshanks, Jus primae noctis, allowing the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth, "the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any."  

=== Occupation and independence === invaded by King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom. 

=== Portrayal of William Wallace ===
As John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett write, "Because   Wallace is one of Scotlands most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to", summarized from Scots scholar Matt Ewart:
 
 Hanseatic cities of Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck and History of Hamburg|Hamburg". She finds that in Braveheart, "any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and a farmer—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate."   

Colin McArthur writes that Braveheart "constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, nationalist guerrilla leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state."  Writing about Braveheart s "omissions of verified historical facts", McArthur notes that Wallace made "overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk", as well as "the well-documented fact of Wallaces having resorted to conscription and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve."   Canitz posits that depicting "such lack of class solidarity" as the conscriptions and related hangings "would contaminate the movies image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable primus inter pares among his peasant fighters." 

=== Portrayal of Isabella of France === Edward III, was a product of the affair. In reality, Isabella was three years old and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died.   (This aspect of the plot may however have been inspired by Sydney Goodsir Smiths play The Wallace: A Triumph In Five Acts, which unhistorically has Isabella present at the Battle of Falkirk longing for a "real man".) At that time it would also have been unusual to send a woman on a diplomatic mission into a war zone.

=== Portrayal of Robert the Bruce ===

 .]]
 English more than once in the earlier stages of the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and he probably did not fight on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk (although this claim is made by one important medieval source, John of Forduns chronicle). Later, the Battle of Bannockburn was not a spontaneous battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years.  His title before becoming king was Earl of Carrick, not Earl of Bruce. 

=== Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward ===

The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his character for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife Eleanor of Castile, and as a religious man he gave generously to charity. The films scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Edward died on campaign and not in bed at his home. 
 Edward II Piers Gaveston who lived on into the reign of Edward II. The Princes male lover Phillip was loosely based on Piers Gaveston. 

Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:
 

In response to Longshanks defenestration of the Princes male lover Phillip, Gibson replied: "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... Hes terrible to his son, to everybody." {{citation

| accessdate = 13 February 2010}} 
Gibson asserted that the reason Longshanks kills his sons lover is because the king is a "Psychopathy|psychopath".   Gibson expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder.

=== Wallaces military campaign ===
"MacGregors from the next glen" joining Wallace shortly after the action at Lanark is dubious, since it is questionable whether Clan Gregor existed at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home was Glen Orchy, some distance from Lanark. 

Wallace did win an important victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, but the version in Braveheart is highly inaccurate, as it was filmed without a bridge (and without Andrew Moray, joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Longshanks nephew.   (However this was not as wide of the mark as Blind Harry, who has Wallace making it to the outskirts of London, and only refraining from attacking the city after an appeal by the Mayors wife.)

The "Irish conscripts" at the Battle of Falkirk are also unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were actually Welsh people|Welsh), and it is anachronistic to refer to conscripts in the Middle Ages (although there were feudal levies). 

=== Use of the Irish or uilleann pipes ===
 
Throughout the film the soundtrack makes use of the Irish uilleann bagpipes and at one point during Wallaces fathers funeral, the Scottish bagpipes being played at the funeral are accompanied by the uilleann pipes in the soundtrack. Not only are the pipes from the wrong country, the chances of there being any bagpipes at the funeral were very slim as the Highland pipes were only used in Scotland from 1400 onwards.

== Accusations of Anglophobia == John Sutherland writing in The Guardian stated that: "Braveheart gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia".     {{cite book

==Sequel==
 
In May 2015, emails from Sony Entertainment executives that were exposed by Wikileaks, revealed that an unofficial sequel to Braveheart, currently titled Lion Rampant is in development.  According to the emails, David Mackenzie is attached to direct the film, which is being made by Working Title.  The sequel will focus on Robert the Bruce and events after Wallaces death.  

Sophie Marceau, Brendan Gleeson, David OHara and John Kavanagh are rumored to be reprising their roles. Tom Hiddleston is in negotiations to star in the film as the Bruce.  Emma Stone is also in talks to star, while Jack OConnell is being considered to play a villain.  Max Von Sydow, Mackenzie Crook, Olivia Williams, Scott Glenn, Rupert Graves, Peter Mullan, Sarah Bolger, Lee Ingleby, Lucy Boynton and Geoff Bell are all rumored to have been added to the cast.
