==Plot== Egyptologist and linguist Daniel Daniel Jackson the chance to translate the Egyptian hieroglyphs on the cover stones. Jackson accepts and travels to a US Air Force installation where he examines the stones. Special Operations Colonel Jack ONeil arrives to take command of the project and he declares it "classified" before Jackson can begin his research.

Jackson deduces from the hieroglyphs the existence of a "stargate", a device used to travel to distant worlds. He discovers that the accompanying non-hieroglyphic symbols are star constellations used in a three-dimensional coordinate system. When selected in sequence on the metal ring, they create a stable wormhole to some other place in the galaxy. ONeil leads a team with Jackson through the Stargate, and they find themselves inside a pyramid in the middle of a desert. The team cannot return home because the necessary coordinates are missing. Jackson, ONeil, and the others explore the surrounding area and discover a mining operation run by humans. The miners assume that they are emissaries of their god Ra.
 Ancient Egyptian. The soldiers develop a friendship with local teenager Skaara and his friends, and Jackson is given the chieftain Kasufs daughter Shauri as a gift. He initially rebuffs her, unaware that she is meant to be his wife, but they develop a friendship that blossoms into romance. Jackson guesses that Shauri may know the location of the cartouche containing the return coordinates for the Stargate. Jackson learns that the Egyptian god Ra was an alien lifeform who came to Earth seeking a cure for his impending death. Ra discovered that he could maintain a simpler Human body indefinitely, and he "possessed" the body of a human youth, enslaved the youths people and transported some of them to another planet to mine the mineral on which all of his technology is based. The enslaved Humans on Earth eventually rebelled and expelled Ra, and buried the Stargate. Fearful of a similar rebellion on this planet, Ra outlawed reading and writing so the people would forget their origins. Jackson discovers six symbols of the return coordinates but the seventh symbol is missing.
 mined mineral. ONeil tries to disarm the guards and kill Ra, but Jackson is killed and ONeil and his team are imprisoned. Jackson is regenerated in a sarcophagus-like device and meets with Ra. Ra states that he will kill Jackson and everyone who has seen him unless Jackson kills the rest of the team to remind Kasufs people that Ra is their true god.

Once Ra has the local people gathered before the pyramid, Skaara and his friends create a distraction while Jackson turns one of the guards weapons on Ra. In the confusion, Jackson and ONeils team escape and take shelter in a cave with Skaara and the others. The next morning, Skaara draws a picture of the victory against Ra, and Jackson realizes that Skaara has drawn the seventh symbol needed to reactivate the Stargate.

ONeil and Skaaras group attack and overpower the overseers of the mine and convince the people that their "gods" are human. With their help, ONeils team return to the Stargate to deactivate the bomb. Faced with open rebellion, Ra prepares his ship to leave and launches fighters to counter-attack. Shauri is killed in the battle, but Jackson takes her into the ship and resurrects her in Ras sarcophagus device. Ra orders the augmented bomb be sent to Earth immediately. Ras guard captain discovers ONeil, and they fight. Jackson and Shauri are captured by Ra, but ONeil overpowers the guard and activates a teleportation device. The beam decapitates the guard captain and sends the head to Ra, while retrieving Jackson and Shauri. As Ras craft escapes the planet, ONeil and Jackson teleport the bomb to Ras ship. The bomb detonates, killing Ra and destroying the ship. Skaaras people celebrate their freedom and Jackson decides to remain on the planet with Shauri. ONeil and the survivors of his team return to Earth.

===Directors cut===
The Directors cut had several scenes which were cut from the theatrical film version. The first such scene took place immediately after the excavation of the Stargate in 1928 and showed petrified Horus guards near the cover stones; the producers had tried to introduce the idea that beings had attempted to come through the Stargate after its burial, but they cut the scene for time concerns.

===Development===
The film was originally planned to play out in a chronological order, but when Devlin and Emmerich edited the film to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of   had been filmed. The scene of the excavation of the Stargate was also filmed in three days in Arizona. A golden look was achieved by filming near the time of sunset.  To keep within the limit of the budget, the producers put stick figures with cloth in the distant desert to appear as humans. The original Stargate was painted black, but it looked like a giant tire so it was repainted silver at the last moment. 

Daniel Jacksons lecture on his theories was filmed in a hotel in Los Angeles.  The scene was originally much longer and delved more into the theories that aliens had built the Egyptian pyramids, but the scene was trimmed for time concerns for the release.  The scenes with ONeil at his house were the first scenes filmed with Kurt Russell; his hair was cut short afterwards. Russell requested his hair color to be brightened a little for the film.  The fictional facility housing the Stargate was the largest set for the film, located in Long Beach, California.  Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith joined production to make all Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and spoken language as accurate as possible. 

===Filming=== David Arnolds first work on an American feature film. When Devlin and Emmerich first flew to London to meet with Arnold, they had not yet heard the score; hearing it, they felt "he had elevated the film to a whole other level".    Arnold later interviewed the actors during principal photography, using the information to improve his score. 

===Visual effects===
Jeff Kleiser and Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co.s visual effects team of 40 people created the look of the Stargate. They used self-written image-creation and compositing software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards, and the cityscape of Nagada. Footprints in the sand were often digitally removed. The creation of the wormhole, which was fully digital, was one of the biggest challenges in the making of the film. The ripples had to be digitally composited to appear accurate and realistic. Scanning lasers were lined up parallel to the gate to illustrate the amount of body that passed the surface of the Stargate plane. Afterwards, the parts of the body that had or had not yet gone through the gate (depending of the side of filming) were obliterated with a digital matte - a process that removes unwanted components from an individual frame or sequence of frames.  The use of computers generating a big 3D storyboard allowed Emmerich to try out different shooting angles before settling on one angle. 

===Music and soundtrack===
 
The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold, played by the Sinfonia of London and conducted by Nicholas Dodd.    It was the second motion picture Arnold had composed and the first major motion picture. At the time of Stargates production, David Arnold had recently started to work in a local video store in London. Once Arnold got the job, he spent several months in a hotel room working on the soundtrack, spending more time rewriting the music and improving it as delays were being created due to film companies trying to get the rights to release the film.    According to Arnold "when I first read the script for StarGate, I knew what approach to take, which was to be as big and bold as possible," he kept on saying:   

 

==Release==

 Ed Wood, Ben Hur". TV series, but not quite."    After the release of the movie, Emmerich and Devlin were sued by an Egyptology student, claiming he had written the story and given them the idea. The suit was later settled out of court.

==Future==
Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich always envisioned Stargate as the first part of a trilogy of films, but parts two and three were never developed.    At Comic-Con 2006, 12 years after the original film was released, writer/producer Dean Devlin stated that he was in early discussions with rightsholders MGM about finally bringing the final two parts to the screen.   

===Sequels===
According to Devlin, the second film is intended to be set around 12 years after the original, with Daniel Jackson making a discovery that leads him back to Earth and to the uncovering of a new Stargate. The second movie would supposedly use a different mythology from the Egyptian one which formed the background to the original movie, with the third movie tying these together to reveal that "all mythologies are actually tied together with a common thread that we havent recognized before." " " (July 20, 2006). ComingSoon.net  Devlin stated that he hoped to enlist original stars Kurt Russell (Col. Jack ONeil) and James Spader (Dr. Daniel Jackson) for the sequels. The actors have reportedly expressed an interest in participating in the project.   

The film trilogy would not directly tie into the Stargate SG-1 series. According to Devlin, the relationship between the movie and the series is "we would just continue the mythology of the movie and finish that out. I think the series could still live on at the end of the third sequel. So were going to try to not tread on their stories."  Plans for sequels to the original film are unrelated to the development of straight-to-DVD movies made as sequels to Stargate SG-1. Using some of Roland Emmerichs notes, Bill McCay wrote a series of five novels, continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, which involved the Earth-humans, the locals and the successors of Ra. According to Devlin, he and Emmerich had always planned to do three films with the potential for more, but MGM preferred to play out the television series first.   

===Television spin-offs===
  series of five novels based on Emmerichs notes, continuing the story the original creators had envisioned. Showtime on July 27, 1997 and ended its ten-season run in 2007. Stargate SG-1 itself spawned the non-canon animated television series Stargate Infinity (2002–2003), and the live-action television series Stargate Atlantis (2004–2009) and Stargate Universe (2009–2011).

===Differences from the series===
 .   ]]

SG-1 creators and executive producers Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner altered the canon by introducing several new concepts during production of the SG-1 and Atlantis series. Most notably, many characters were portrayed by different actors in the series, and names were spelled differently.  Daniel Jackson was played by James Spader in the movie and by Michael Shanks in the series. Kurt Russells character Jonathan "Jack" ONeil, a rather humorless Colonel, is played by Richard Dean Anderson as Jonathan "Jack" ONeill (with two Ls) in SG-1.       French Stewarts character was named Lieutenant Louis Ferretti, in SG-1, Brent Staits character is named Major Louis Ferretti. The spelling of Daniel Jacksons wife changes from Shauri to Share, ONeills wife from Sarah to Sara, (similarly, the name of ONeils son changes from Tyler in the film to Charlie).   
 Cheyenne Mountain Abydos in CG by the Canadian visual effects company Rainmaker.  At the beginning of Season 9, the original movie wormhole sequence was substituted by a new sequence similar to the one already used on Stargate Atlantis, but being blue as it was in the movie and SG-1, whereas in Atlantis its green. 

==Reboot==

On September 5, 2013, during an interview with Digital Spy, Emmerich said that he and MGM are planning a  new Stargate as a reboot with a trilogy.  On May 29, 2014, it was announced that MGM and Warner Bros. are partnering together for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing, Devlin producing and Nicolas Wright & James A. Woods writing.
