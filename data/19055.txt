Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992) is a  , which he co-wrote with Edward S. Herman.

The film presents and illustrates Chomskys and Hermans thesis that corporate media, as profit-driven institutions, tend to serve and further the agendas of the interests of dominant, elite groups in the society. A centerpiece of the film is a long examination of the history of The New York Times coverage of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, which Chomsky says exemplifies the medias unwillingness to criticize an ally of the elite.
 The Corporation (2003), made by Mark Achbar, Jennifer Abbott and Joel Bakan, it was the most successful feature documentary in Canadian history, played theatrically in over 300 cities around the world; won 22 awards; appeared in more than 50 international film festivals; and was broadcast in over 30 markets. It has also been translated into a dozen languages.

Chomskys response to the film was mixed; in a published conversation with Achbar and several activists, he stated that the film simply doesnt communicate his message, leading people to believe that he is the leader of some movement that they should join. In the same conversation, he criticizes The New York Times review of the film, which mistakes his message for being a call for voter organizing rather than media critique.
