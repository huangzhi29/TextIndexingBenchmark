}} Hong Kong martial arts John Saxon Jim Kelly. This was Bruce Lees final film appearance before his death on 20 July 1973. The film was released on 26 July 1973, six days after Lees death, in Hong Kong. He was also one of the films writers.

Often considered one of the greatest martial arts films of all time, in 2004, Enter the Dragon was deemed "culturally significant" in the United States and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry  of the Library of Congress.

Enter the Dragon was the first Chinese martial arts film to have been produced by a major Hollywood studio – Warner Bros. and was produced in association with Bruce Lee|Lees Concord Production Inc. The film is largely set in Hong Kong.
 Seven Little Golden Harvest studios, which later launched their careers. The portly Hung is shown fighting Lee in the opening sequence of the movie and Chan shows up as a henchman when Lee is discovered inside Hans underground lair.

The finished version of the film was not significantly different from the original screenplay. Bruce Lee did not revise the script. Bruce Lee directed the films opening Shaolin Monastery fight sequence. Lee wanted to use the film as a vehicle for expressing what he saw as the beauty of his Chinese culture, rather than it being just another action film. The original script contained most of the dialogue in the movie. 

==Plot==
Lee (Bruce Lee) is a Shaolin martial artist from Hong Kong who possesses great philosophical insight into martial arts as well as physical prowess. He receives an invitation to a martial arts competition on an island organised by the mysterious Mr. Han (Shih Kien). Lee learns from his Sifu (teacher) that Han was also once a Shaolin student, but had been expelled from their order for abusing their code of conduct.

A British Intelligence agent named Braithwaite approaches Lee and asks for his help in an undercover mission. Han is suspected to be involved in drug trafficking and prostitution. However, since Hans island is only partly in their jurisdiction, they are unable to conduct any formal investigations – Han will not allow firearms on the island, both to impede assassination attempts and to prevent the international authorities from gaining a justification to launch a raid. Han runs a martial arts school to protect his drug operations, as well as holding his tournament every three years to recruit international talent to expand his criminal business. Lee agrees to help Braithwaite, believing his efforts will also redeem the Shaolin honour that Han has tarnished. However, Lee then learns from his father that Hans bodyguard OHara had been involved in the death of his sister, Su Lin. Despite feeling ashamed of himself, Lee then finds himself compelled on a mission of revenge as well.

Lee arrives on Hans island and receives a warm reception. Joining him are other competitors including Roper, a down-on-his-luck white American playboy-gambler on the run from the mob, and Williams, an African-American activist on the run after defending himself against two racist white policemen in Los Angeles. Roper and Williams are old friends who also have a betting scam going: one will under-perform until the other can get a bet on the outcome at good odds. Both win their first fights easily.

That night, the competitors are all offered girls of their choice by Hans assistant, Tania. Williams chooses several women, while Roper cunningly chooses Tania (as a mutual attraction is apparent between them). Lee asks for a girl he saw earlier in Hans entourage, who he remembers from Braithwaites briefing as Mei Ling, an agent whom Braithwaite had placed on the island to gather intelligence: however, she has been unable to escape Hans strict observation. That night, leaving Mei Ling in his bedroom, Lee begins searching the island for evidence and finds a secret entrance to an underground base, where drugs are being manufactured and tested on unwitting prisoners. He runs into Hans guards but manages to take them down and flee before they can identify him. He is seen by Williams, who is outside for some fresh air and practice, despite strict rules against being outside after dark.

The next day, Han warns the competitors about wandering out of their rooms at night. He punishes his guards for failure in their duties by leaving them in the hands of Bolo, his sadistic chief enforcer. Moments later, Lee is called to his first match and his opponent turns out to be OHara, who is clearly outclassed and eventually killed when he attacks Lee with broken bottles. Announcing that OHaras dishonorable attack has caused him to lose face very badly, Han ends the days matches. Later, Han summons Williams and accuses him of attacking the guards the previous night. Williams denies this, claiming he wasnt the only one out at night, but changes the subject about leaving the island. As Williams defies him, Han summons his henchmen; Williams takes them out but Han himself is also skilled and beats Williams to death with his cast iron prosthetic left hand.

Later Han takes Roper on a tour of his underground base and invites him to be his representative for his heroin smuggling operations in the United States. Roper is reluctant, but Han shows him the mutilated corpse of Williams and dropping him in an acid pool, hinting that Roper will face the same fate if he refuses to co-operate. The same night, Lee breaks into the underground base and gathers sufficient evidence to warrant Hans arrest, but sets off an alarm while messaging Braithwaite. After fighting with dozens of Hans guards he is eventually lured into a trap and captured.

The next morning, Han asks Roper to fight Lee as a test of his loyalty. Roper refuses, so Han has him fight Bolo instead, but Roper defeats him. The infuriated Han then orders all his men to kill both Lee and Roper. Despite being hopelessly outnumbered, Lee and Roper manage to hold off the enemy until Mei Ling releases the captives in Hans underground prison, who join them in the fight and even the odds. Amidst the chaos, Han attempts to fight his way out, only to have Lee chase him to his museum, where Han retrieves a bladed replacement for his hand. After realising he is outmatched in the museum, Han retreats into a room full of mirrors, which proves disorientating for Lee, until he smashes all the mirrors to foil Hans illusions and allow him to defeat Han, impaling him on his own spear. When Lee returns to Roper, he finds that most of Hans men have been defeated and rounded up, but Roper also finds Tanias lifeless body lying amongst the wreckage. Lee and Roper exchange a weary thumbs-up just as military helicopters arrive in response to the distress call.

==Production==
 
The scene in which Lee states that his style was the style of "Fighting Without Fighting" and then lures Parsons into boarding a dinghy is based upon a famous anecdote involving the 16th century samurai Tsukahara Bokuden.      

Jackie Chan appears as a guard during the underground lair battle scene and gets his neck snapped by Lee. He also performed several stunts for the film, including the scene where Lees character quickly climbs a rooftop at night. However Yuen Wah was Lees main stunt double for the film, most notably for the more acrobatic feats in the film, such as flipping over the abbots arms at the beginning and the scene where Lee does a back-flip when OHara catches his leg during their fight. 

The title of the film was originally intended to be Blood and Steel.

Enter The Dragon was filmed without sound. All of the dialogue and effects were dubbed in during post-production.

===Music===
 
Argentinian musician Lalo Schifrin composed the films musical score. While Schifrin was widely known at the time for his jazz scores, he also incorporated funk and traditional film score elements into the films soundtrack.

===Critical response=== Doctor No" with elements of Fu Manchu.  J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters wrote, "Of course the real showcase here is the obvious star here, Bruce Lee, whose performance as an actor and a fighter are the most enhanced by the perfect sound and video transfer. While Kelly was a famous martial artist and a surprisingly good actor and Saxon was a famous actor and a surprisingly good martial artist, Lee proves to be a master of both fields." 

The film currently holds a 95% approval rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, with 43 reviews counted and an average rating of 7.8/10.  In 2004, the film was deemed "culturally significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
