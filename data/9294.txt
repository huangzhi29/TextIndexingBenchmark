The Evil Dead is a 1981 American horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi and executive produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who also stars alongside Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. The Evil Dead focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audiotape that releases a legion of demons and spirits, members of the group suffer from demonic possession, leading to increasingly gory mayhem.  Raimi and the cast produced the short film Within the Woods as a "prototype" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US$90,000 to produce The Evil Dead. The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in Morristown, Tennessee, in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the majority of the cast and crew.

The low-budget horror film attracted the interest of producer Irvin Shapiro, who helped screen the film at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Horror author Stephen King gave a rave review of the film, which helped convince New Line Cinema to serve as its distributor. Though a meager commercial success in the United States, the film made its budget back through worldwide distribution, and grossed $2.4 million during its theatrical run. Both early and later critical reception were both universally positive and in the years since its release, The Evil Dead has developed a reputation as one of the largest cult films and has been cited among the greatest horror films of all time. The Evil Dead launched the careers of Campbell and Raimi, who would collaborate on several films together throughout the years, including Raimis Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man trilogy.

==Plot==
The Evil Dead focuses on five   and his girlfriend Linda, accompanied by Ashs sister Cheryl, their friend Scotty, and his girlfriend Shelly, who venture into the Tennessee hills to vacation in an isolated cabin for their spring break.  They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross.  That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a deformed, evil face.  She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination.
 Naturon Demonto, tape recording demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape.  The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed.  Back at the cabin, while the girls play cards, Cheryl becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them.  She then stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil, and Scotty locks her in the cellar.

Shelly is the next to become possessed; she attacks Scotty, who eventually dismembers her with an axe.  They bury her, and Scotty, emotionally shaken by her death, leaves to find an alternate trail through the woods.

Checking on Linda, Ash discovers that she, too, has become possessed, although she makes no attempt to attack him.  Scotty returns, suffering from grave injuries caused by the possessed trees. Before losing consciousness, he tells Ash that an alternate trail does exist.  Linda and Cheryl unsuccessfully attempt to deceive Ash into believing they are no longer possessed, only to attack him again.  He locks Linda outside the cabin and tends to Scottys injuries, but she sneaks in through the back-door and attacks Ash with a ceremonial dagger, which he uses to impale her.  Taking her body to the woodshed, Ash tries to force himself to dismember her with a chainsaw, but finds himself unable to do it and buries her instead.  She rises from the grave and attacks him, forcing him to decapitate her with a shovel.

Returning to the cabin, Ash finds that Cheryl has escaped from the cellar.  Arming himself with a shotgun, he finds her hiding outside and shoots her in the shoulder.  He then descends into the cellar to search for more shotgun shells after barricading the doors.  While there, he hears voices and sees blood seeping from numerous crevices and openings in the walls.

A demonically possessed Scotty tries to kill Ash as Cheryl breaks through the door.  During their fight, Ash sees that the Book of the Dead has fallen near the fireplace and is starting to burn, as are Cheryl and Scotty.  As Cheryl raises a fireplace poker to impale him, Ash snatches the book and throws it into the fire.  With the book burnt, Cheryl and Scotty fall apart and die as the sun rises.

As Ash heads outside, an unseen evil speeds through the forest, breaks through the doors of the cabin and descends upon him.  He turns around and screams in terror before the film cuts to the end credits.

==Production==
  directed the short film Within the Woods to generate the interest of investors for The Evil Dead. |thumb|right|upright]]

===Background and writing=== Winston Dixon Campbell (2002), Egan (2011), Campbell (2002), Becker (2002), Lamberson (2008), Campbell (2002), pp.&nbsp;85–88 

To generate funds for the film, Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends.   Raimi showed him Within the Woods, and although Gillis was not impressed by the short film, he offered Raimi legal advice on how to produce The Evil Dead. With his advice in mind, Raimi asked a variety of people for donations, and even eventually "begged" some.  Campbell had to ask several of his own family members, and Raimi asked every individual he thought could be interested.  He eventually raised enough money to produce a full-length film, though not the full amount he originally wanted.

 Kenneth Muir (2004), pp.&nbsp;23–24  To acquire more actors for the project, an ad in The Detroit News was placed. Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast.  The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbells friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi. 

Without any formal assistance from location scouts, the cast had to find filming locations on their own. The crew initially attempted to shoot the film in Raimis hometown of Royal Oak, Michigan, but instead chose Morristown, Tennessee, as Tennessee was the only state that expressed enthusiasm for the project. The crew quickly found a remote cabin located several miles away from any other buildings.  During pre-production, the thirteen crew members had to stay at the cabin, leading to several people sleeping in the same room. The living conditions were notoriously difficult, with several arguments breaking out between crew members.

===Filming=== Campbell (2002), Konow (2012), pp.&nbsp;419–422  One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Bakers eyelashes during removal of her face-mask.  Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass had to be applied to the actors to achieve the "demonic eyes" effect.  The lenses took ten minutes to apply, and could only be left on for about fifteen minutes because eyes could not "breathe" with them applied.  Campbell later commented that to get the effect of wearing these lenses, they had to put "Tupperware" over their eyes. 

Raimi developed a sense of mise en scène, coming up with ideas for scenes at a fast rate.  He had drawn several crude illustrations to help him break down the flow of scenes. The crew was surprised when Raimi began using dutch angles during shots to build atmosphere during scenes.  To accommodate Raimis style of direction, several elaborate, low-budget rigs had to be built, since the crew could not afford a camera dolly. One involved the "vas-o-cam", which relied on a mounted camera that was slid down long wood platforms to create a more fluid sense of motion.

 Egan (2011), p. 17  Several sounds were not recorded properly during shooting, which meant the effects had to be redone in the editing rooms. Dead chickens were stabbed to replicate the sounds of mutilated flesh, and Campbell had to scream into a microphone for several hours. 

Much like Within the Woods, The Evil Dead needed to be blown up to 35mm, then the industry standard, to be played at movie theaters.  The relatively large budget made this a much simpler process with The Evil Dead than it had been with the short film.

It was his idea not to use the then-title Book of the Dead, because it made the film sound boring. Raimi brainstormed several ideas, eventually going with The Evil Dead, deemed the "least worst" title.  Shapiro also advised distributing the film worldwide to garner a larger income, though it required a further financial investment by Raimi, who managed to scrape together what little money he had.

===Home video release=== Cannon Video later repackaged the film. Congress Video, a company notable for public domain films, issued their version in 1989.  

The resurgence of The Evil Dead in the home-video market came through two companies that restored the film from its negatives and issued special editions in 1998: Anchor Bay Entertainment on VHS, and Elite Entertainment on laserdisc. Anchor Bay was responsible for the films first DVD release in 1999, and between them, Elite and Anchor Bay have released six different DVD versions of The Evil Dead, most notably a 2002 "Book Of The Dead" edition, packaged in a latex replica of the Necronomicon sculpted by Tom Sullivan.  The films high-definition debut was in a 2010 Blu-ray. 

==Reception==

===Early reception===
Upon its release, contemporary critical opinion was mostly positive.  Bob Martin, editor of Fangoria, reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it "might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films".  The Los Angeles Times called the film an "instant classic", proclaiming it as "probably the grisliest well-made movie ever."   In a 1982 review, staff from the trade magazine Variety (magazine)|Variety wrote that the film "emerges as the ne plus ultra of low-budget gore and shock effect", commenting that the "powerful" and inventive camerawork was key to creating a sense of dread. 
 Egan (2011), The Exorcist and The Omen, citing it as a key supernatural thriller. 

===Later reception===
The film continues to receive universal acclaim from modern critics. The   magazine stated the films "reputation was deserved", writing that the film was impressive considering its low budget and the casts inexperienced nature. He commented that the film successfully blended the "bizarre" combination of Night of the Living Dead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Three Stooges.  A reviewer for Film4 rated The Evil Dead four-and-a-half stars out of five, musing that the film was "energetic, original and icky" and concluding that Raimis "splat-stick debut is a tight little horror classic that deserves its cult reputation, despite the best efforts of the censors." 
 The Last House on the Left. Glanville noted that other than the "ill-advised trees-that-rape scene", the film is "one of the great modern horror films, an even more impressive when one considers its modest production values." 
 Time Out Summer (2007), p. 165 

J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters said, "What is unquestionable is that the Raimis and their pals created a monster in The Evil Dead. It started as a disastrous failure to obtain a big break with a too long, too perilous shoot (note Campbell’s changing hairstyle in the various scenes of the one-day plot). The film went through name changes and bannings only to survive as not only the ultimate experience in grueling horror but as an oft-imitated and cashed-in-on classic, with 30 years of positive reviews to prove it." 

==Aftermath==
  at a fan convention, signing a VHS of The Evil Dead. |thumb|right|upright]] Campbell (2002), Campbell (2002), p. 171  Other people involved with the film expressed similar disappointment with the project.   Fortunately, Raimi had the studio support to make a sequel to The Evil Dead, which he initially decided to make out of desperation. 
 Campbell (2002), Konow (2012), pp.&nbsp;429–434    Army of Darkness had 22.8 times the budget of the original Evil Dead, though it was not considered to be a box-office success like its two predecessors.   Evil Dead II received general acclaim from critics and is often considered to be better than the original, and Army of Darkness received mostly positive reviews.  The series has often attracted attention because each sequel featured more comedic qualities than the last, progressing into "weirder" territory with each film. 

Unofficial sequels were also made in Italy—where the film was known as La Casa ("The House")—by   was reissued in Italy as La Casa 6, and The Horror Show was then released in Italy as La Casa 7.   

===Legacy=== trilogies in Lavery (2009), Campbell (2002), p. 337  which have become some of the highest-grossing films in history.     Though it has often been considered an odd choice for Raimi—a director known for his violent horror films—to direct a family-friendly franchise, the hiring was mostly inspired by Raimis passion for the comic books as a kid.     Raimi returned to the horror-comedy genre in 2009 with Drag Me to Hell.

 remake of the film was released in 2013, directed by Fede Alvarez and produced by Raimi and Campbell. It features actress Jane Levy as the main character, with Ash not appearing.     Campbell does make a brief, uncredited cameo appearance at the end of the film in a short post-credits scene.
