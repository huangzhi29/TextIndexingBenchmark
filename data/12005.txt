The sixteenth film in Tohos Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla series, it marked the beginning of a rebooted series of Godzilla films that ignores all the films from 1955s Godzilla Raids Again through 1975s Terror of Mechagodzilla. The film acts as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla. Produced as part of Godzillas 30th anniversary, the film returned the series to the darker themes and mood of some of the early films and returned Godzilla to his destructive antagonistic roots. 

In 1985, New World Pictures released Godzilla 1985, a heavily re-edited American adaptation of the film which included new footage shot exclusively for its North American release, which featured Canadian actor Raymond Burr reprising his character from Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, which was also produced, re-shot, and re-edited with the same techniques.

==Plot==
Three months after a volcanic eruption on Daikoku Island, the Yahata-Maru Japanese fishing vessel is caught in strong currents off its shores. As the boat drifts into shore, the island begins to erupt, and a giant monster lifts itself out of the volcano. A few days later, reporter Goro Maki is sailing in the area and finds the vessel intact but deserted. As he explores the vessel, he finds all the crew dead except for one young man called Hiroshi Okumura, who has been badly wounded. Suddenly a giant Shockirus sea louse attacks but is eventually killed with some difficulty.
 Soviet submarine. The Soviets believe the attack was done by the Americans, and a diplomatic crisis ensues, which threatens to escalate into Cold War|war. The Japanese intervene and finally announce that Godzilla was behind the attack. The Japanese arrange a meeting with the Soviet and American ambassadors and, after some debate over the issue, Prime Minister Mitamura decides nuclear weapons will not be used on Godzilla even if it were to attack the Japanese mainland. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces are put on alert and search for Godzilla.

Soon, Godzilla appears on an island off the coast of Japan, determined to feed off a nuclear power plant there. When Godzilla attacks the facility and feeds off the reactor, it is distracted by a flock of birds, and leaves the facility almost as quickly as it arrived. Okumura and his friends realize that Godzilla reacts to the same signal as birds, and Professor Hayashida decides to use this method to lure Godzilla away from Tokyo. Meanwhile, the Soviets have their own plans to counter the threat posed by Godzilla, and a Soviet control ship disguised as a freighter in Tokyo Harbor prepares to launch a nuclear missile from one of their orbiting satellites should Godzilla attack.
 JASDF attacks Godzilla with Mitsubishi F-1 fighter jets, but their missiles are useless against it and it shoots two of them down with its thermonuclear ray. Godzilla then proceeds to the coast, where the waiting army, equipped with tanks, rocket launchers and soldiers armed with Howa Type 64 assault rifles, proceeds to fire on Godzilla, but they are quickly subdued by a long blast of its atomic ray. At the same time, the Soviet ship hits the harbor and damages the ship and its circuitry, leaving the missile countdown on a timer that must be manually deactivated. The crew captain is the last member on the ship and attempts to stop the missile from launching. However, he is killed by an explosion due to an equipment malfunction. Godzilla then climbs out of the docks and proceeds towards Tokyos business district, wreaking havoc along the way. There, it is confronted by four laser-armed trucks known as Hyper Laser Cannons which lure the monster away from Professor Hayashidas laboratory, and then the Super X, a piloted VTOL craft constructed in secret to defend Tokyo in case of emergency, in particular a nuclear attack.

Because Godzillas heart is similar to a nuclear reactor, the cadmium shells that are fired into its mouth by the Super X seal and slow down its heart. Unfortunately, during the fight, the city is faced with a greater threat when the countdown ends and the Soviet missile is launched from the satellite, leaving the Japanese government and people helpless to stop it. After unleashing its atomic breath on the Super X, Godzilla falls down unconscious. As the missile is predicted to hit Tokyo in 30 minutes, the Americans intervene and fire a counter missile at the Soviet missile. Professor Hayashida and Okumura are extracted from Tokyo via helicopter and taken to Mt. Mihara on Oshima island to set up the bird call device before the two missiles collide above Tokyo. The American counter missile soon hits the Russian missile and Tokyo is saved. Unfortunately, the atmospheric nuclear blast creates an electrical storm and an EMP, which revives Godzilla once more and temporarily disables the Super X. 

Godzilla has a final battle with the Super X, eventually damaging the aircraft and forcing it to make an emergency landing where Godzilla destroys it by toppling a building on it. Godzilla continues his rampage, until Professor Hayashida is successful with his invention and uses the bird call device to distract it. Godzilla leaves Tokyo and swims across the Japanese sea to volcanic Mount Mihara|Mt. Mihara, where he notices the signal device. As Godzilla walks towards the device, Godzilla falls into the mouth of the volcano, which is surrounded by detonators. Okumura activates the detonators, creating a controlled volcanic eruption that traps Godzilla for good.

==Development==
Disagreeing with Tohos decision to lay the series to rest, producer and creator Tomoyuki Tanaka began developing ideas for a reboot immediately after the release of Terror of Mechagodzilla. Several scripts were prepared, with the idea of returning the franchise back to the dark nuclear roots of the original 1954 film. 

==Production==
The screenplay was first written in 1980, but as an entirely different film. Godzilla was to fight a shape-shifting monster named Bagan (Godzilla)|Bagan, and the Super X played a much smaller role. Elements of the original screenplay were translated to the 1995 Super Nintendo game known as Super Godzilla.

Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka offered Ishir≈ç Honda a chance to direct this film, but he strongly rejected the offer, because of what came of Godzilla in the 1970s, and his belief that Godzilla should have been permanently laid to rest after Eiji Tsuburayas death.   Also, at this time, he was busy assisting his friend Akira Kurosawa with films he was directing, such as Kagemusha and Ran (film)|Ran. 
 throat cancer before production began. Yosuke Natsuki, another veteran, took the role instead. Stuntman Kenpachiro Satsuma (who previously played Hedorah and Gigan in the original Godzilla films) played Godzilla for the first time, as a replacement for another stuntman who backed out at the last minute.

Aside from being heavy, the suit was very dangerous (it was not only built from the outside in, but not made to fit him), and Satsuma lost a lot of weight during filming. This mildly mirrored what Haruo Nakajima went through when he played Godzilla in the original 1954 film.  Subsequent Godzilla suits worn by Satsuma were much safer and more comfortable, as they were custom-made to fit him (even though the suits still had some dangers of their own).
 Razzie Award for "Worst New Star" after the release of Godzilla 1985. A full-size replica of Godzillas foot was also built, albeit all of the scenes in which it is used were removed from the American version (the sole exception being a shot of the foot crushing a row of parked cars during the attack on the nuclear power plant).
 international version", titled The Return of Godzilla is uncut and was released in the United Kingdom in the 1990s. So far, this version has not been made available in the United States.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The Return of Godzilla was a reasonable success in Japan, with attendance figures at approximately 3,200,000 and the box office gross being approximately $11 million (the films budget was $6.25 million). 

When Godzilla 1985 failed at the box office, it was the last Godzilla film produced by Toho to receive any major release in North American theaters until Godzilla 2000 fifteen years later.

=== Critical reception === original Godzilla film.

=== Awards ===
In 1985, the film won the Japan Academy Award for Special Effects. 

== Home video ==
The international version was released on VHS (dubbed in English) in the UK in 1998. The running time matches that of the Japanese version, and the only notable difference is the English text and dubbing. This version of the film has remained unreleased in both the USA and Canada.

This film was distributed to DVD in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Thailand, Spain, Italy and France, but never officially in the United States and Canada due to legal issues. Since the release of Godzilla vs. Biollante in 2012, The Return of Godzilla remains the only Godzilla film to not have been officially released on DVD in the United States.

== Adaptations == 1988 Dark Horse Comics released a six-issue limited series, Godzilla (comics)|Godzilla, which was an American adaptation of the Japanese manga adaptation of The Return of Godzilla.
