}} epic war written and directed by Wolfgang Petersen, produced by Günter Rohrbach, and starring Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann. It has been exhibited both as a theatrical release and as a TV miniseries, and in several different home video versions of various running times.
 Type VIIC-class U-boat.

Development for Das Boot began in 1979. Several American directors were considered three years earlier before the film was shelved. During the films production, Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, the captain of the real U-96 and one of Germanys top U-boat "tonnage aces" during the war, and Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on  , served as consultants. One of Petersens goals was to guide the audience through "a journey to the edge of the mind" (the films German tagline Eine Reise ans Ende des Verstandes), showing "what war is all about".

==Plot==
The story is told from the viewpoint of Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer), who has been assigned as a war correspondent on the German submarine German submarine U-96 (1940)|U-96 in October 1941. He meets its captain (Jürgen Prochnow), chief engineer (Klaus Wennemann), and the crew in a French nightclub. Thomsen (Otto Sander), another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his Knights Cross of the Iron Cross|Ritterkreuz award, in which he openly mocks not only Winston Churchill but implicitly Adolf Hitler as well.

The next morning, they sail out of the harbour of La Rochelle to a cheering crowd and playing band. Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are often mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boats spotting of an enemy convoy. They soon locate a British destroyer, but are bombarded with depth charges. They narrowly escape with only light damage.

The filthy officers seem out of place on the opulent luxury liner, but are warmly greeted by enthusiastic officers eager to hear their exploits.

 Allied planes bomb and strafe the facilities, wounding or killing many of the crew. Ullmann, Johann and the 2nd Watch Officer are killed. Frenssen, Bootsmann Lamprecht and Hinrich are badly wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the submarine pen|U-boat bunker in which he had taken shelter and finds the captain, with multiple bullet wounds and bleeding from the mouth, watching the U-boat sink at the dock. The captain collapses after the boat disappears under the water. Werner runs to the captains body, recoils, and quickly glances around at the destruction, his face frozen with horror.

* Jürgen Prochnow as Captain lieutenant|Kapitänleutnant (abbr. "Kaleun",  )  and also called "Der Alte" ("The Old Man") by his crew: A 30-year-old battle-hardened sea veteran, who complains to Werner that most of his crew are boys. 
* Herbert Grönemeyer as Leutnant (Ensign) Werner, War Correspondent: The naive but honest narrator sent out to sea with the crew to gather photographs of them in action and bring them back to use for Nazi Propaganda purposes. Werner is mocked for his lack of experience, and soon learns the true horrors of service on a U-boat. (Actually the narrator of the story; this is not made explicit in the movie, but still present in the background.)
*   on Cologne. The second most important crewman, as he oversees diving operations and makes sure the systems are running correctly.
* Hubertus Bengsch as 1st Watch Officer (I. WO, Rank: Oberleutnant): A young, by-the-book officer, an ardent Nazi and a staunch believer in victory. He has a condescending attitude and is the only crewman who makes the effort to maintain his proper uniform and trim appearance. Raised in some wealth in Mexico by his stepparents who owned a plantation. His German fiancée died in a British air raid. He spends his days writing his thoughts on military training and leadership for the High Command. Enigma code machine.
* Bernd Tauber as Obersteuermann ("Chief Helmsman") Kriechbaum: The navigator and 3rd Watch Officer (III. WO). Always slightly skeptical of the Captain and without enthusiasm during the voyage, he shows no anger when a convoy is too far away to be attacked. Kriechbaum has four sons, with another on the way.
*  . French fiancée (which is considered treason by the French French Resistance|partisans) and worries about her safety. He is one of the few crew members with whom Werner is able to connect; Werner offers to deliver Ullmanns stack of love letters when Werner is ordered to leave the submarine.
*  . He is in many ways the third most important crewman, since he gauges speed and direction of targets and enemy destroyers. Hinrich is one of the few officers that the Captain is able to relate to.
*  ) are losing a match, and they will "never make the final now". He speaks a Mannheim dialect.
* Claude-Oliver Rudolph as Ario: The burly mechanic who tells everyone that Dufte is getting married to an ugly woman, and throws pictures around of Duftes fiancée in order to laugh at them both.
*  .
*  .
* Joachim Bernhard as Bibelforscher ("Bible scholar", also the contemporary German term for a member of Jehovahs Witnesses): A very young religious sailor who is constantly reading the Bible. He is punched by Frenssen when the submarine is trapped at the bottom of the Straits of Gibraltar for praying rather than repairing the boat.
*  .
* Jean-Claude Hoffmann as Benjamin: A red haired sailor who serves as a diving planes operator and watch officer.
* Lutz Schnell as Dufte: The sailor who gets jeered at because he is getting married, and for a possible false airplane sighting.

*   U-boat commander, who is a member of "The Old Guard". When he is introduced, he is extremely drunk and briefly mocks both Hitler and Winston Churchill on the stage of a French nightclub. (In the audio commentary of the directors-cut DVD, Petersen says that Sander was really drunk while they were shooting the scene.) Sometime after U-96 departs, Thomsen is deployed once again and the two submarines meet randomly in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. After failing to make contact later, the Captain is forced to report to HQ that Thomsen is missing.
*  , he complains about the frustration of not being able to fight, but boasts about the food that has been prepared for the crew and the ships "specialities".
* Sky du Mont as an Oberleutnant aboard the Weser (uncredited). The II. WO amuses him with a comical demonstration of depth charging, involving a bowl of punch, a ladle and oranges.
 Third Reich, around 1941. All of the main actors are bilingual in German and English, and when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part (with the exception of Martin Semmelrogge, who only dubbed his own role in the Directors Cut). The German version is dubbed as well, as the film was shot "silent", because the dialogue spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the gyroscopes in the special camera developed for filming.

The interior U-boat mock-up was mounted five metres off the floor and was shaken, rocked, and tilted up to 45 degrees by means of a hydraulic apparatus, and was vigorously shaken to simulate depth charge attacks. Petersen was admittedly obsessive about the structural detail of the U-boat set, remarking that "every screw" in the set was an authentic facsimile of the kind used in a World War II U-boat. In this he was considerably assisted by the numerous photographs Lothar-Günther Buchheim had taken during his own voyage on the historical U-96, some of which had been published in his 1976 book,  U-Boot-Krieg  ("U-Boat War").

===Special camera===
Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacanos design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had two gyroscopes to provide stability, a different and smaller scale solution than the Steadicam, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up. 

==Versions== Film Editing, Sound (Milan Sound Effects Editing, and Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Writing).   
 WDR and the Süddeutscher Rundfunk|SDR, and much more footage had been shot for the film than was shown in the theatrical version. A version of three 100-minute episodes was transmitted on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in October 1984, and in Germany and Austria the following year. In 1988 a version comprising six 50-minute episodes was screened. These episodes had additional cutback scenes summarising past episodes.

Petersen then oversaw the editing of six hours of film, from which was distilled Das Boot: The Directors Cut, 209 minutes long (3 hours, 29 minutes). Released in 1997, this cut combines the action sequences seen in the feature-length version with character development scenes contained in the mini-series. This release also provides better sound and video quality.  Petersen originally had planned to release this version in 1981, which for commercial reasons was not possible. The Directors Cut was released to cinemas in Germany on 11 December and on 4 April 1997 in the U.S. In addition to the "Directors Cut" DVD, a Superbit version, with fewer additional DVD features but a higher bit-rate (superior quality), was released by Columbia Pictures.

An uncut miniseries version, running 293 minutes (four hours, 53 minutes), was released to DVD on 1 June 2004, as Das Boot: The Original Uncut Version with enhanced video and audio quality. It omits the cutback scenes of the 1988 television broadcast and is therefore shorter.

On 14 October 2010, the 208-minute "Directors Cut" was released on a German-language Blu-ray Disc in Europe.  It was released in the United States on 5 July 2011.
The shortest version begins an evening in a French nightclub. The longer begins in a car that is driving to the same place, and several drunken sailors are pissing at the car, in which the U-boat commander and the guest reporter are sitting. The commander doesnt care, but later the new German-Mexican volunteer officer makes complaints about it. This complaint is also cut in the short version, hence the introduction of this officer becomes very short.
The long version was released for at least cinemas in Sweden at the time. (Long time before 1997.)

In late 2007, there was an exhibition about the film Das Boot, as well as about the real U-Boat U-96, at the Haus der Geschichte (House of German History) in Bonn. Over 100,000 people visited the exhibition during its four-month run.

===Promotion===
The film was unusual in its North American promotion, since it was referred to both in German as Das Boot, and in English as The Boat. The lack of drama in the translated title eventually led to its being marginalized, with Das Boot becoming the normal title for the film.

===Historical accuracy===
Even though the beginning and the end of the film occur in the port of La Rochelle, it does not correspond historically. The submarine base in La Rochelle was not functional before November 1941, and at the time of the film the port was dried up. 

===Criticism by novelist Buchheim===
Even though impressed by the technological accuracy of the films set-design and port construction buildings, novelist Lothar-Günther Buchheim expressed great disappointment with Petersens adaptation in a film review Lothar-Günter Buchheim (1981).   ("Commentary: The truth remained hidden under the sea"), Geo, no. 10, 1981  published in 1981, especially with Petersens aesthetic vision for the film and the way the plot and the effects are, according to him, overdone and clichéd by the adaptation. He also criticised the hysterical overacting of the cast, which he called highly unrealistic, while acknowledging the casts acting talent in general. Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided a script detailing his own narrative, cinematographical and photographical ideas as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director. It would have amounted in full to a complete six-hour epic; however, Petersen turned him down because at the time the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release. However, todays Directors Cut of Das Boot amounts to over 200 minutes, and the complete TV version of the film is 282 minutes long.
 pressure hull would have been enough for the whole crew to worry about the U-boat being crushed by water pressure, while Petersen has several bolts loosening in various scenes). Buchheim also criticized depictions of the crews loud behaviour during patrols as unrealistic and celebrations after achieving a torpedo hit or surviving a bombing as unprofessional. Furthermore, an officer—even an outsider like Lt. Werner—would have commanded special respect and that throwing an oil-drenched towel into his face would not have been tolerated.

Uttering concerns about the end result, Buchheim felt that unlike his clearly anti-war novel the adaptation was "another re-glorification and re-mystification"  of the German World War II U-boat war, German heroism and nationalism. He called the film a cross between a "cheap, shallow American action flick"  and a "contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II".
