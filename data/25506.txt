==Plot==
In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in Flashback (narrative)|flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jakes brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vickie.
 Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.

A year later, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey had an affair with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake directly asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, prompting her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como). Jake angrily walks to Joeys house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of his wife and children. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950,  he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jakes career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951. 

By 1956, Jake and his family have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been planning since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the cops if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957 he goes to jail where he pounds the walls, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him but is elusive. Returning to the opening scene in 1964, Jake refers to the "I coulda been a contender" scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront starring Marlon Brando, complaining that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant "Im the boss" while shadowboxing.

The film cuts to black with the following Biblical quote filling the screen:  So, for the second time,   summoned the man who had been blind and said:
"Speak the truth before God. We know this fellow is a sinner."
"Whether or not he is a sinner, I do not know," the man replied.
"All I know is this: Once I was blind and now I can see."
:John IX. 24–26, The New English Bible  

The film subsequently ends with an on-screen dedication to Scorseses New York University film professor, Haig P. Manoogian: Remembering Haig P. Manoogian, teacher. May 23, 1916—May 26, 1980. With Love and resolution, Marty.

==Production==

===Development===
Raging Bull came about when De Niro read the   on the set of The Godfather Part II. Although disappointed by the books writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese on the set of Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Biskind, Peter, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, 1999, p.254.  Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the directors chair, claiming he had no idea what Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, "A boxer? I dont like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldnt, wouldnt grasp." His overall opinion of sport in general is, "Anything with a ball, no good." Biskind, Peter Easy Riders, Raging Bulls 1998, p.378.  The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the films eventual co-screenwriter, who said "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. Biskind, Peter, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, 1998, p.315.  After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film for De Niros sake, not only to save his own life but also to save what remained of his career. Scorsese knew that he could relate to the story of Jake LaMotta as a way to redeem himself; he saw the role being portrayed as an everyman for whom "the ring becomes an allegory of life", making the project a very personal one for him.

 Michael Chapman, British director Michael Powell, Powell pointed out that the color of the gloves at the time would have only been maroon, oxblood, or even black. Scorsese decided to use this as one of the reasons to film Raging Bull in black and white. Other reasons would be to distinguish the film from other color films around the time and to acknowledge the problem of fading color film stock—an issue Scorsese recognized. Biskind, Peter, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, 1998, p.389.  Total Film, The 100 greatest films of all time, pp. 180–181.  Thompson, David and Christie, Ian, Scorsese on Scorsese, p.80.  Scorsese even went to two matches at Madison Square Garden to aid his research, picking up on minor but essential details such as the blood sponge and later, the blood on the ropes (which would later be used in the film). 

===Screenplay===
Under the guidance of Chartoff and Winkler, Mardik Martin was asked to start writing the screenplay. Biskind, Peter Easy Riders, Raging Bulls 1998, p.379.  According to De Niro, under no circumstances would United Artists accept Mardik Martins script. Biskind, Peter Easy Riders, Raging Bulls pp384-385  The story was based on the vision of journalist Peter Hamill of a 1930s and 1940s style, when boxing was known as "the great dark prince of sports". De Niro was unimpressed when he finished reading the first draft, however. Baxter John De Niro A Biography,pp.186-189.  Taxi Driver screenwriter Paul Schrader was swiftly brought in to re-write the script around August 1978.  Some of the changes that Schrader made to the script saw a re-write of the scene with the uncooked steak and inclusion of LaMotta seen masturbating in a Florida cell. The character of LaMottas brother, Joey, was finally added, previously absent from Martins script.   United Artists saw a massive improvement on the quality of the script. However, its chief executives, Steven Bach and David Field, met up with Scorsese, De Niro, and producer Irwin Winkler in November 1978 to say they were worried that the content would be X-rated material and have no chance of finding an audience. 
 Richard III had been pondered but Michael Powell thought it would be a bad decision within the context of a film that was American.  According to Steven Bach, the first two screenwriters (Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader) would receive credit but since there was no payment to the writers guild on the script, De Niro and Scorseses work would remain uncredited. 

===Casting===
One of Scorseses trademarks was casting many actors and actresses new to the profession, and this film was no exception. Evans, Mike The Making of Raging Bull, p.65.  De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother, Joey, and wife, Vickie. Evans, Mike The Making of Raging Bull, p.61.  Baxter, John De Niro A Biography pp196-201  The role of Joey LaMotta was the first to be cast. De Niro was watching a low budget television film called The Death Collector when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by Joe Pesci (then an unknown and struggling actor) as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was running an Italian restaurant in New Jersey. Pesci initially claimed that it would have to be a good role for him to consider it, and he later accepted the part.

The role of Vickie, Jakes second wife, would have interest across the board, but it was Pesci who suggested the actress, Cathy Moriarty, from a picture he once saw at a New Jersey disco.  Both De Niro and Scorsese believed that Moriarty could portray the role after meeting with her on several occasions and noticing her husky voice and physical maturity. The duo had to prove to the Screen Actors Guild that she was right for the role when Cis Corman showed 10 comparing pictures of both Moriarty and the real Vickie LaMotta for proof she had a resemblance.  Moriarty was then asked to take a screen test which she managed&mdash;partly aided with some improvised lines from De Niro—after some confusion wondering why the crew were filming her take. Joe Pesci also persuaded his former show-biz pal and co-star in The Death Collector, Frank Vincent, to try for the role of Salvy Batts. Following a successful audition and screen test, Vincent received the call to say he had received the part. Evans, Mike, The Making of Raging Bull, pp.&nbsp;65/66.  Charles Scorsese, the directors father, made his film debut as Tommy Comos cousin, Charlie. 

While in the midst of practicing a   as coach at the Gramercy club in New York, getting him into shape. The actor found that boxing came naturally to him; he entered as a middleweight boxer, winning two of his three fights in a Brooklyn ring dubbed "young LaMotta" by the commentator. According to Jake LaMotta, he felt that De Niro was one of his top 20 best middleweight boxers of all time.  

===Principal photography===
  Michael Chapman, would be placed inside the ring as he would play the role of an opponent keeping out of the way of other fighters so that viewers could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake.  The precise moves of the boxers would be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of Arthur Murray. A punching bag which sat in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before aggressively coming straight on to do the next scene.  Thompson and Christie, Scorsese on Scorsese, pp. 83–84.  The initial five-week schedule for the shooting of the boxing scenes took longer than expected, putting Scorsese under pressure. 

According to Scorsese, production of the film was then closed down for around four months with the entire crew being paid, so De Niro could go on a binge eating trip around Northern Italy and France.   When he did come back to the United States, his weight increased from 145 to 215&nbsp;pounds (66 to 97&nbsp;kg).  The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta—which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta ending up in a Florida cell—were completed while approaching Christmas 1979 within seven to eight weeks so as not to aggravate the health issues which were already affecting De Niros posture, breathing, and talking.   Baxter, John, The Making of Raging Bull, p.83. 

According to production sound mixer, Michael Evje, Jakes nightclub sequence was filmed in a closed-down San Pedro club on December 3. The jail cell head-banging scene was shot on a constructed set with De Niro asking for minimal crew to be present—there was not even a boom operator.

The final sequence where Jake LaMotta is sitting in front of his mirror was filmed on the last day of shooting taking 19 takes, with only the thirteenth one being used for the film. Scorsese wanted to have an atmosphere that would be so cold that the words would have an impact as he tries to come to terms with his relationship with his brother. 

===Post-production=== Frank Warner Cutty Sark" which was heard in a scene. The work was completed only four days shy of the premiere. Baxter, John De Niro A biography, p.204. 

=== Copyright litigation ===
Paula Petrella, heir to Frank Petrello whose works were allegedly sources for the film, filed for copyright infringement in 2009 based on MGMs 1991 copyright renewal of the film.  In 2014, the Supreme Court held that Petrellas suit survived MGMs defense of "laches (equity)|laches", the legal doctrine that protects defendants from unreasonable delays by potential plaintiffs.  The case was remanded to lower courts, meaning that Petrella may now receive a decision on the merits of her claim. 

==Reception==

===Box office=== theatrical rentals (about $27 million in 2013 dollars).  Scorsese became concerned for his future career and worried that producers and studios might refuse to finance his films.  According to Box Office Mojo, the film grossed $23,383,987 in domestic theaters.   

===Critical reception===
Raging Bull first premiered in New York on November 14, 1980 to polarized reviews. Biskind, Peter Easy Riders, Raging Bulls 1999, p.399.   Jack Kroll of Newsweek called Raging Bull the "best movie of the year".  Vincent Canby of The New York Times said that Scorsese "has made his most ambitious film as well as his finest" and went on to praise Moriartys debut performance as "either she is one of the film finds of the decade or Mr. Scorsese is Svengali. Perhaps both." Evans, Mike The Making of Raging Bull pp124-129  Time (magazine)|Time praised De Niros performance since "much of Raging Bull exists because of the possibilities it offers De Niro to display his own explosive art".  Steven Jenkins from the British Film Institutes (BFI) magazine, Monthly Film Journal, said "Raging Bull may prove to be Scorseses finest achievement to date".

==Soundtrack==
Martin Scorsese decided to assemble a soundtrack made of music that was popular at the time using his personal collection of 78s. With the help of   from Silvano, and the Intermezzo from Guglielmo Ratcliff.  A two-CD soundtrack was released in 2005, long after the film was released, because of earlier difficulties receiving permissions for many of the songs, which Scorsese selected from his childhood memories growing up in New York.

==Sequel==
In 2006,   as an older LaMotta and Morjean Aria as the younger version (before the events of the first film).   The film, directed by Martin Guigui also stars Joe Mantegna, Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, Natasha Henstridge, Alicia Witt, Ray Wise, Harry Hamlin,  and James Russo as Rocky Graziano.   In July 2012, MGM, owners of United Artists, filed a lawsuit against LaMotta and the producers of Raging Bull II to keep the new film from being released. The former party argued that they have rights to make any authorized sequel to the original book, which goes back to an agreement LaMotta and co-author Peter Savage made with Chartoff-Winkler, producers of the original film. In addition, MGM argues that the defendants are publicly claiming the film to be a sequel to the original film, which could most likely "tarnish" its predecessors reputation.  In August 2012, the producers retitled the film The Bronx Bull, disassociating itself as a sequel to Raging Bull, and the lawsuit was subsequently dropped.
