 cult following. Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness (1992).

==Plot==
The film begins with a recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods (Due to not having the rights to the first film and limited funding they didnt show the other characters). While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology professor (the cabins previous inhabitant), reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force which kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel when she attacks him, he then buries her.

Next theres a scene   where the evil force charges through the forest, through the cabin and into Ash (According to Raimi & Cambell this is where the recap ends and the 2nd film actually begins).  Next we see that Ash is thrown across the forest and is briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is forced out of him, and Ash turns back to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading out of the woods is destroyed, and, due to being unconscious for some time, the sun is rapidly setting. As night falls, Linda returns from the dead and attacks Ash, biting his hand with her severed head. Ash brings Lindas head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the body before turning then chainsaw on Lindas head, finally killing her. Ash soon discovers that the bite has caused his own hand to become murderously possessed, and he is forced to dismember it. When he finds that it still lives on after being severed, he seemingly kills it with a shotgun he finds in the cabin.

While Ash is surviving in the cabin, the professors daughter, Annie, returns from a dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow. Having been unable to contact her father at his isolated cabin, Annie, with her research partner Ed Getley in tow, drives there, only to find the destroyed bridge blocking her route. The pair enlist the help of two road workers, Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe, to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. Meanwhile, Ash is apparently slowly being driven insane by his situation. This includes an experience with a room full of laughing inanimate objects; whether this experience is caused by the evil force or hallucinated is unclear.

Annie and her party arrive at the cabin. On their arrival, Ash, mistaking them for the presence, fires at them, wounding Bobby Joe. He is beaten unconscious by Jake, and, believing that Ash killed her father, Annie helps to lock him in the cabins cellar. They soon find and listen to a recording of Annies father, describing how his wife Henrietta was possessed and he, unable to bring himself to dismember her, buried her in the cellar. The possessed Henrietta rises from the cellar floor, and the group releases Ash before locking the cellar door once again in order to trap Henrietta. Ed is soon possessed and subsequently dismembered by an axe-wielding Ash. The group is then visited by the spirit of Annies father, who tells her that, by using the pages of the Necronomicon that she brought with her, she can save the group. Bobby Joe is attacked by Ashs still-living hand and attempts to flee, but is attacked by the demon trees in the woods and dragged to her death. Annie translates two of the pages, learning that, by reciting incantations that they hold, she can first force the evil presence to manifest itself in the flesh, before opening a rift in time and space to send it away. Before she can begin translating and reciting the incantations, Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, holding them at gunpoint to force them to go looking for Bobby Joe. Outside the relative safety of the cabin, Ash is once again possessed and turns on his remaining companions, incapacitating Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and, mistaking him for the demon, accidentally stabs Jake. She drags him to safety, only to accidentally leave him near the cellar door, where he is dragged into the cellar by Henrietta and killed. The possessed Ash tries to kill Annie, but stops when he sees Lindas necklace, reminding him of her. He is freed from the possession, and manages to convince Annie that he is normal again.

Ash, with Annies help, modifies the chainsaw and attaches it to where his right hand had been. Arming himself with both the chainsaw and his shotgun, Ash journeys into the cellar to find the missing pages of the Necronomicon. He finds them (and Jakes skeleton), before proceeding to leave. However as he is going up the steps to safety, Henrietta surprises him and temporarily disables him, before going after Annie. Ash then recovers, declaring "Lets go" before facing her in combat. Although she throws him against the wall at the start, the still "humanly shaped" deadite receives a beating from Ash and after receiving a blow from the butt of the chainsaw, falls. However she then begins to transform into a more "demonic" form with a much longer head and, with Ash pinned down at a wall, gains the upper hand. However Annie recites a song that Henrietta used to sing to her as a child. Distracted, the deadite is dismembered by Ash, before he blasts the head apart with the shotgun.

Annie chants the first incantation. The incantation causes the evil to manifest and attack the cabin, but, before she can recite the second, Ashs possessed hand kills her with a dagger. As Ash fends off the evil by impaling it in the eye with the chainsaw, Annie uses her dying breaths to recite the second incantation, opening up a whirling temporal portal which draws in not only the evil force, but nearby trees, the Oldsmobile, and Ash himself.

Ash and his Oldsmobile fall through the portal and out of the sky. He is immediately confronted by a group of knights who initially mistake him for a being called a "deadite", but they are quickly distracted when a real one  appears. Ash blasts the harpy-like deadite with his shotgun. The knights begin cheering for him, and, as he realizes he has been brought to the past, he cries "No!". He is revealed to be standing in front of an intact, populated version of the ruin in which Annies father uncovered the Necronomicon.

==Production==
The concept of a sequel to The Evil Dead was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Raimi wanted to toss his hero, Ash, through a time portal, back into the Middle Ages. That notion eventually led to the third installment, Army of Darkness.
 comedy produced Joel and Ethan Coen. Irvin Shapiro, a publicist who was primarily responsible for the mainstream release of The Evil Dead, suggested that they next work on an Evil Dead sequel. Raimi scoffed at the idea, expecting Crimewave to be a hit, but Shapiro put out ads announcing the sequel regardless.

After Crimewave was released to little audience or critical reaction, Raimi and Tapert, knowing that another flop would further stall their already lagging careers, took Shapiro up on his offer. Around the same time, they met Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis, the owner of production and distribution company De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|DEG. He had asked Raimi if he would direct a theatrical adaptation of the Stephen King (written under his Richard Bachman pseudonym) novel Thinner (novel)|Thinner. Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis continued to be interested in the young filmmaker.    

The Thinner adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of Kings successful horror fiction. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, Maximum Overdrive, based on his short story "Trucks (short story)|Trucks". He had dinner with a crew member who had been interviewed about the Evil Dead sequel, and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at Cannes Film Festival|Cannes, called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film.  

Though initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed after being presented with the extremely high Italian grosses for the first film. Although Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, they were allotted only $3.6 million. As such, the planned medieval storyline had to be scrapped.  

===Script===
Though they had only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of Crimewave. Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the Super 8 mm films they had produced during their childhood in Michigan. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that Evil Dead II should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original films characters, but, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other iterations, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.  
 Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates, and Holly Hunter (Hunter was the primary inspiration for the Bobby Jo character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, Crimewave and Josh Beckers Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except, the script took an inordinately long time to finish.  

Among the films many inspirations include The Three Stooges and other slapstick comedy films; Ashs fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager, entitled Attack of the Helping Hand, which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising Hamburger Helper. The "laughing room" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a Popeye-esque laugh. Spiegels humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes; for instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is A Farewell to Arms.  

===Filming=== The Color Purple in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for Evil Dead II. Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, which is where the interior cabin set was located.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Evil Dead II opened on March 13, 1987 to a weekend gross of $807,260. At this time, it was only in 310 theatres, resulting in its smaller gross. However, after spending a little over a month in theatres, the film ultimately grossed $5,923,044 domestically.   

===Critical response===
 , it holds a score of 69/100 based on twelve reviews.  Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine praised the film, saying "the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book" and confirms that "Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods".  Caryn James of The New York Times called it "genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimis talent and developing skill."  Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars,  but later increased the rating to three stars. 

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a three star rating (out of four) describing it as "a fairly sophisticated satire, that makes you want to get up and shuffle." He praised the films sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and "grubby, low-budget intensity." Ebert states that "if you know its all special effects, and if youve seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2."    Richard Harrington of the Washington Post wrapped up his review stating that "the acting is straight out of 50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?"    Conversely, Pat Graham of Chicago Reader disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that "The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimis aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort Id say hes overshot the mark." 

Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #19 on their list of "The Top 50 Cult Films".   

Sight and Sound ranked it #34 on their 50 Funniest Films of All Time list. In 2008, Empire magazine included Evil Dead II on their list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, ranked #49. 

J.C. Maçek III of PopMatters wrote, "Equal parts remake and sequel, the second film brought back Bruce Campbell as Ash and was every bit as gory and horrific as the first film with more tree rape and dismemberment and blood splatters than ever. On the other hand, Evil Dead II is also an absolutely hilarious and uproarious intentional comedy."
