==Plot==
Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is a sexually frustrated housewife who is in therapy with New York City psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine). During an appointment, Kate attempts to seduce him, but Elliott rejects her advances.

Kate goes to the Metropolitan Museum. In a ten-minute sequence entirely without dialogue, she has an unexpected flirtation with a mysterious stranger. Kate and the stranger "stalk" each other through the museum until they finally wind up outside, where Kate joins him in a taxi. They begin to have sex and continue at his apartment, unaware that Kate has left her underwear on the floor of the cab.

Hours later, Kate awakens and, thoroughly satisfied with her evening, decides to discreetly leave while the man, Warren Lockman, is asleep. Kate sits at his desk to leave Warren a note and finds a document indicating that he has contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Mortified, she leaves the apartment. But in her haste, she has left her wedding ring on the strangers nightstand, so she returns to retrieve it.
 Nancy Allen), happens upon the body. She catches a glimpse of the killer, therefore becoming both the prime suspect and the killers next target.

Dr. Elliott receives a bizarre answering machine message from "Bobbi," a transgender patient. Bobbi taunts the psychiatrist for breaking off their therapy sessions, apparently because Elliott refuses to sign the necessary papers for Bobbi to get a sex change operation. Elliott tries to convince Dr. Levy, the patients new doctor, that Bobbi is a danger to herself and others.

A police detective, Marino (Dennis Franz), is skeptical about Lizs story, partly due to her profession, so Liz joins forces with Kates revenge-minded son Peter to find the killer. Peter, an inventor, uses a series of homemade listening devices and time-lapse cameras to track patients leaving Elliotts office. They catch Bobbi on camera, and soon Liz is being stalked by a tall blonde figure in sunglasses. Several attempts are subsequently made on Lizs life. One, in the New York City Subway, is thwarted by Peter, who sprays Bobbi with homemade Mace (spray)|mace.

Liz and Peter scheme to learn Bobbis real name by getting inside Dr. Elliotts office to look at his appointment book. Liz baits the therapist by stripping to lingerie and coming on to him, distracting him long enough to make a brief exit and leaf through his appointment book. Peter is watching through the window when a Blonde lady pulls him away. When Liz returns, the tall blonde figure with the razor confronts her; Peter shouts to Liz when the blonde figure is about to attack Liz. However, the blonde lady outside shoots and wounds the blonde figure, the wig falls off, it is Doctor Elliott revealing that he is Bobbi. The blonde lady who shot Bobbi is actually a female police officer who looks like Bobbi, revealing herself to be the tall blonde figure who has been trailing Liz.

Elliott is arrested by the police and placed in an insane asylum. It is explained by Dr. Levy that Elliott wanted to be a woman, but his "male" side would not allow him to go through with the operation. Whenever a woman sexually aroused Elliott, it was "Bobbi," representing the female side of the doctors personality, who became threatened.

In a final sequence, Elliott escapes from the asylum and slashes Lizs throat in a bloody act of vengeance. She wakes up screaming, Peter by her side, realizing that it was just a dream.

Two versions of the film exist in North America, an Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated version and an unrated version. The unrated version is around 30 seconds longer and shows more pubic hair in the shower scene, more blood in the elevator scene (including a close-up shot of the killer slitting Kates throat), and some sexier dialogue from Liz during the scene in Elliotts office. These scenes were trimmed when the MPAA originally gave the film an X rating|"X" rating.
