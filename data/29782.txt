}} crime comedy Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowling|bowler. After he becomes the victim in a case of mistaken identity, The Dude finds a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski who was the intended victim. When the millionaire Lebowskis trophy wife is kidnapped, he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dudes friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the full ransom. Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi also star, with David Huddleston, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Thewlis and Tara Reid appearing in supporting roles.

The film is loosely inspired by the work of   was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers.
 cult favorite,  noted for its idiosyncratic characters, dream sequences, unconventional dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.  In 2014, The Big Lebowski was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. 

==Plot== Philip Moon) who demand money that the wife of a Jeffrey Lebowski owes to a man named Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara). The two soon realize they have attacked the wrong Jeffrey Lebowski and leave, but not before one of them urinates on The Dudes rug.

The Dude meets his bowling friends, the timid Donny (Steve Buscemi) and the temperamental Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Encouraged by Walter, the Dude approaches the other Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), the eponymous "Big Lebowski", a cantankerous elderly millionaire in a wheelchair, to seek compensation for his ruined rug. This request is promptly refused. He craftily steals one of Lebowskis rugs by telling Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Lebowskis sycophantic assistant, that his boss told him to take any rug in the house. The Dude subsequently meets Bunny (Tara Reid), Lebowskis young nymphomaniacal trophy wife.

Days later, Lebowski contacts the Dude stating that Bunny has been kidnapping|kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude to deliver a briefcase containing a million dollar ransom and see if he can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dudes apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowskis rug. When Bunnys kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter suggests they give the kidnappers a "ringer" briefcase filled with dirty laundry instead. The kidnappers grab the ringer and leave. Later that night, the Dudes car is stolen, with the ransom briefcase still inside.

Lebowski is angry that the Dude failed to deliver the ransom and shows him what is apparently Bunnys severed toe, delivered by the kidnappers. Later, a gang of German nihilists (Peter Stormare, Torsten Voges, and Flea (musician)|Flea) invade the Dudes apartment and threaten him, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. Maude says the German nihilists are actually Bunnys friends.
 White Russian cocktail, leading to an unconscious dream sequence involving Maude and bowling. The Dude comes to in police custody, where he is verbally and physically assaulted by the sheriff. During the cab ride home, the Dude gets thrown out after a trivial argument with the driver about The Eagles. A red sports car zooms past; Bunny is driving, with all her toes intact.

The Dude finds his bungalow completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged him so that his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dudes home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude is about to protest the idea of being a father when Maude tells him that he wont have a hand in the childs upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. The Dude later tells Walter that he now understands the whole story: when Lebowski heard that Bunny was kidnapped, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends—the nihilists—purported a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski.

The affair apparently over, the Dude and his bowling teammates return to the bowling alley.  When they leave, they are confronted in the parking lot by the nihilists who have set the Dudes car on fire. They once again demand the ransom money. After hearing what the Dude and Walter know, the nihilists try to mug them anyway. Walter violently overcomes all three of them. However, in the excitement, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack.

Walter and the Dude go to the beach to scatter Donnys ashes. Walter turns an informal eulogy into a tribute to the Vietnam War. After accidentally covering the Dude with Donnys ashes, and after a brief argument Walter hugs him and says, "Come on. Fuck it, man. Lets go bowling." At the bowling alley, the storys narrator (Sam Elliott) tells the camera that Maude is pregnant with a "little Lebowski" and expresses his hope that the Dude and Walter will win the bowling tournament.

==Cast== White Russians, and Ten-pin bowling|bowling. Bridges had heard or was told by the Coen brothers that they had written a screenplay for him.   

* John Goodman as   Walter Sobchak, a Vietnam veteran, the Dudes best friend, and bowling teammate. Walter places the rules of bowling second in reverence only to the rules of his adopted religion, Judaism, as evidenced by his strict stance against "rolling" on shabbat|Shabbos. He has a violent temper, and is given to pulling out a handgun (or crowbar) in order to settle disputes. He says the Gulf War was all about oil and claims to have "dabbled" in pacifism. He constantly references Vietnam in conversations, much to the annoyance of the Dude. Walter was based, in part, on screenwriter John Milius.  

*   and good-natured, Donny is an avid bowler and frequently interrupts Walters diatribes to inquire about the parts of the story he missed or did not understand, provoking Walters frequently repeated response, "Shut the fuck up, Donny!" This line is also a reference to Fargo (film)|Fargo, the Coen brothers previous film, in which Buscemis character was constantly talking. 

* David Huddleston as Jeffrey Lebowski, the "Big" Lebowski of the movies title, is a wheelchair-bound (he lost the use of his legs in the Korean War) apparent multi-millionaire who is married to Bunny and is Maudes father by his late wife. The films primary antagonist, he refers to the Dude dismissively as "a bum" and a "deadbeat" in the perspective of referencing the hippie lifestyle, and is obsessed with "achievement". Although he characterizes himself as highly successful and accomplished, it is revealed by Maude that he is simply "allowed" to run some of the philanthropic efforts of her mother’s estate, and that he actually does not have money of his own.

* Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, an avant-garde artist and feminist, whose work "has been commended as being strongly vaginal". Though fond of her mother, she took back the Dudes replacement rug due to it being a maternal family heirloom, her pursuits and lifestyle lead to a falling out with her conservative father. She may have introduced Bunny to Uli Kunkel. She helps the Dude along his case of finding Big Lebowskis missing money in the sake of her mothers estate, and in the end, beds the Dude solely to conceive a child, and wants nothing else to do with him. She is straightforward in manner, and has a very precise style of speaking.

* Tara Reid as Bunny Lebowski, the Big Lebowskis young gold digging "trophy wife". Born Fawn Knutsen (correctly pronounced "Kuh-nootson"), she started as an attractive high school cheerleader and ran away from the family farm outside Moorhead, Minnesota to find stardom and riches in Los Angeles. She soon found herself making pornographic videos under the name "Bunny La Joya", and eventually lead to her marriage with the Big Lebowski. According to Reid, Charlize Theron tried out for the role.  

* Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, the Big Lebowskis personal assistant, who plays mediator between the two Lebowskis.

* Sam Elliott as The Stranger, an old-time cowboy, who is also the narrator, and who sees the story unfold from a third-party perspective. He has a thick, laid-back Texas accent. Towards the end of the film he is seen in the bar of the bowling alley, and converses directly with the Dude on two occasions. He expresses disapproval of The Dudes use of profanity and his laziness, and adds the qualifier "parts of it anyway" when speaking to the camera commenting that he enjoyed the story.
 pornographer and loan shark, who lives in Malibu, California|Malibu, and employs the two thugs who assault the Dude at the beginning of the film. Bunny owes him a large sum of money. He states in disappointment of how the nature of the porno enterprise market has fallen from erotic romantic buildups and "the brain" to purely raunchy sexual material, but the Dude describes him as a man who treats objects like women.
 Flea play nihilists (Uli Kunkel, Franz, and Kieffer, respectively). They are German musicians (Kunkel, as "Karl Hungus", appeared in a porn film with Bunny), who, along with Kunkels girlfriend (Aimee Mann), pretend to be the ones who kidnapped Bunny. The character of Uli originated on the set of Fargo between Ethan Coen and Stormare, who often spoke in a mock German accent.  
 North Hollywood Chino for exposing himself to an 8-year-old. Turturro originally thought he was going to have a bigger role in the film; when he read the script, he realized the part was quite small. However, the Coen brothers let him come up with a lot of his own ideas for the character, like shining the bowling ball and the scene where he dances backwards, which he says was inspired by Muhammad Ali.  

===Minor characters===
* Jon Polito as Da Fino, a private investigator hired by Bunnys parents, the Knutsons, to entice their daughter back home. He mistakes The Dude for a "brother shamus".
* David Thewlis as Knox Harrington, the video artist
* Mark Pellegrino as Treehorns blond thug Philip Moon as Woo, the rug-peeing "Chinaman"
* Jimmie Dale Gilmore as Smokey

==Production==

===Development=== Seattle Seven, The Big Wednesday. 

According to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann "who worked naked from a swing" and on Yoko Ono.   The character of Jesus Quintana was inspired, in part, by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988, at the Public Theater in a play called Mi Puta Vida in which he played a pederast-type character, "so we thought, lets make Turturro a pederast. Itll be something he can really run with," Joel said in an interview.  

The films overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and thats why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes".  The use of the Strangers voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, "He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler its the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didnt want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. Its as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain."  

The significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, "important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless."  

===Screenplay=== Walter Hill The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges".   When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way weve already accumulated pieces for several future movies."   In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process.  In the original script, the Dudes car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.  

===Pre-production=== PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with a budget of $15&nbsp;million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing whos going to play the role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John   and Steve  , but we didnt know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role."  In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude."   The actor went into his own closet with the films wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear.   He wore his characters clothes home because most of them were his own.  The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly.   Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the "Gladiator" or what they called the "Chin Strap" and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.  

For the films look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music   and for it to be "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview.   For example, the star motif featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the films production designer Richard Heinrichs design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he "came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior". This carried over to the films dream sequences. "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs.   For Jackie Treehorns Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorns beach party to be Inca-themed, with a "very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So theres a very sacrificial quality to it."  

Cinematographer Roger Deakins discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look.   Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals.   The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgskys Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.  

===Principal photography===
Actual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks)  and the Dudes Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. {{Cite news

 }}  According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges "was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over? Id reply Yes usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot."   Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on  . She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997  while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.  

===Architecture===
The scenes in Jackie Treehorns house were shot in the Sheats Goldstein Residence, designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills. 

Deakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dudes apartment, Deakins said, "its kind of seedy and the lights pretty nasty" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect.   The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.  
 CGI was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.

}} original score Hotel California", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind.  They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, "T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac."  Burnett was able to secure the rights to the songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and the rights to a relatively obscure Bob Dylan song called "The Man in Me".  However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandts cover of the Rolling Stones "Dead Flowers", which plays over the films closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, "It got to the part where the Dude says, I hate the fuckin Eagles (band)|Eagles, man! Klein stands up and says, Thats it, you can have the song! That was beautiful."   Burnett was going to be credited on the film as "Music Supervisor", but asked his credit to be "Music Archivist" because he "hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldnt want anyone to think of me as management". 

For Joel, "the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies".   Music defines each character. For example, "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was "Lujon" by Henry Mancini for Jackie Treehorn. "The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So theres a musical signature for each of them", remarked Ethan in an interview.   song and Autobahn (album)|album.

==Release and critical reception==
The Big Lebowski received its world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 1998 at the 1,300-capacity Eccles Theater.  It was also screened at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival   before opening in North America on March 6, 1998 in 1,207 theaters. It grossed USD $5.5&nbsp;million on its opening weekend, grossing US$17&nbsp;million in the United States, just above its US$15&nbsp;million budget. The films worldwide gross outside of the US was $28 million, bringing its worldwide gross to $46,189,568. 

Many critics and audiences have likened the film to a modern Western (genre)|Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices.  Peter Howell, in his review for the Toronto Star, wrote: "Its hard to believe that this is the work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of Fargo. Theres a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps."  Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and more recently stated that "it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film."   

Todd McCarthy in   gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the Dude was "too passive a hero to sustain interest", but that there was "enough startling brilliance here to suggest that, just like the Dude, those smarty-pants Coens will abide". 
 Desson Howe praised the Coens and "their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana&nbsp;– but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented&nbsp;– the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better." 

 , in his review for the  , Ian Nathan wrote: "For those who delight in the Coens divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana" and "In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers."  Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "weirdly engaging".  In a 2010 review, Ebert gave The Big Lebowski four stars out of four and added the film to his "Great Movies" list. 

However,   criticized the film as "a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes. But it does have some terrific jokes." 

The Big Lebowski has an approval rating of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

==Legacy== cult classic. Santa Cruz decided to screen The Big Lebowski and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before.  

  and Jeff Bridges at the 2011 Lebowski Fest]]
An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities.  The festivals main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have even attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event.  The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London. 

Dudeism, an online religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the films main character was founded in 2005. Also known as The Church of the Latter-Day Dude, the organization has ordained over 220,000 "Dudeist Priests" all over the world via its website. 

  of the   magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" poll.  Roger Ebert added The Big Lebowski to his list of "Great Movies" in March 2010. 

John Turturro has suggested a number of times that he would be interested in doing a spin-off film using his character Jesus Quintana. If the project got off the ground, the Coens would not direct it but may have a part in writing it. 

===Use as social and political analysis===
The film has been used as a tool for analysis on a number of issues. In September 2008, Slate (magazine)|Slate published an article which interpreted The Big Lebowski as a political critique. The center piece of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is "a neocon", citing the films references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War. 
 Camera Obscura uses the film to explain Karl Marxs commodity fetishism and the feminist consequences of sexual fetishism. 

It has been used as a Carnivalesque critique of society, as an analysis on war and ethics, as a narrative on mass communication and US militarism and other issues.
