==Plot==
The film follows the adventures of a group of friends through the eyes of Charles (Hugh Grant), a good-natured but socially awkward British people|Briton, who is smitten with Carrie (Andie MacDowell), an American whom Charles repeatedly meets at four weddings and at a funeral.
 Timothy Walker) and Laura (Sara Crowe), at which Charles is the best  man. Charles and his collection of single friends wonder if they will ever get married. At this wedding, Charles meets Carrie for the first time and spends the night with her. Carrie teases him by pretending that, now they have been to bed together, they will also have to get married, to which Charles endeavours to respond before realising she is joking. She then goes back home to America, observing that they may have missed an opportunity.

The second wedding is that of Bernard (David Haig) and Lydia (Sophie Thompson), a couple who got together at the previous wedding. Charles is happy to discover that Carrie is attending the wedding, until she introduces him to her fiancé, Sir Hamish Banks (Corin Redgrave), a wealthy politician from Scotland. At the reception, Charles finds himself seated at a table with several ex-girlfriends who relate embarrassing stories about his inability to be discreet and afterwards bumps into Henrietta (Anna Chancellor), known among Charles friends as "Duckface", with whom he had a particularly difficult relationship.

As the evening wears on, Charles finds himself in an empty hotel suite, sadly watching Carrie and Hamish leave in a taxicab, only to be trapped in a small cupboard after the newlyweds suddenly stumble into the adjoining room to have sex. After Charles awkwardly exits the room, Henrietta confronts him about his habit of "serial monogamy", telling him that he is afraid of letting anyone get too close to him. Shortly after this encounter, Charles runs into Carrie (without her fiancé), and they end up spending another night together.

A month later, Charles receives an invitation to Carries wedding, in Scotland. While shopping for a present in London, he accidentally bumps into Carrie in a shop and ends up helping her select her wedding dress. Carrie also astonishes him with a list of her more than thirty sexual partners (he learns he is #32). He later tries to confess his love to her and hints that he would like to have a relationship with her. However, he says it rather lamely, and the confession obviously comes too late.
 depressed at the prospect of Carries marrying Hamish. As the reception gets under way, Gareth (Simon Callow) instructs his friends to go forth and seek potential mates; Fionas brother, Tom (James Fleet), stumbles through an attempt to connect with a woman until she innocently reveals that she is the ministers wife, while Charless flatmate, Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman), strikes up a conversation with a tall, attractive American named Chester. As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance as husband and wife, Charless friend Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) deduces his feelings about Carrie. When Charles asks why Fiona is not married, she confesses that she has always loved Charles since they first met years ago. Charles is appreciative and empathetic but does not requite her love. During the grooms toast, Gareth dies suddenly of a heart attack.
 John Hannah) recites the poem "Funeral Blues" ("Stop all the clocks...") by W. H. Auden, commemorating his relationship with Gareth.   After the funeral, Charles and Tom have a discussion about whether hoping to find your "one true love" is just a futile effort and ponder that, while their clique have always viewed themselves as proud-to-be-single, Gareth and Matthew had in fact been a "married" couple among them all the while.
 sign language that he suspects the groom is having doubts and loves someone else. The vicar asks whether Charles does love someone else, and Charles replies, "I do." Henrietta punches Charles, bringing the wedding to an abrupt halt.

Carrie visits Charles afterward to apologise for coming to the wedding. Charles confesses that, while standing at the altar, he realised that for the first time in his life he totally and utterly loved one person, "and it wasnt the person standing next to me in the veil." Charles makes a proposal of lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie, saying, "Do you think not being married to me might maybe be something you could consider doing for the rest of your life?" Carrie responds by saying, "I do."

The song "Chapel of Love" is then played as we see Henrietta marrying an officer in the Grenadier Guards, David marrying his girlfriend Serena (Robin McCaffrey), Scarlett marrying Chester, Tom marrying his distant cousin Deirdre (whom he met, for the second time in 25 years, at Charless wedding and instantly fell for), Matthew with a new partner (Duncan Kenworthy), Fiona marrying Prince Charles, and Charles and Carrie with their son (apparently unmarried).

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was very well received with critics, currently holding a 95% "Certified Fresh" approval on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the sites consensus stating, "While frothy to a fault, Four Weddings and a Funeral features irresistibly breezy humor, and winsome performances from Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell." 

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it "delightful and sly", and directed with "light-hearted enchantment" by Newell. He praised Grants performance, describing it as a kind of "endearing awkwardness". 

The film did have its detractors, though. Writing for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum called the film "generic" and "standard issue", stating that the audience shouldnt "expect to remember it ten minutes later".
