  independent zombie domestically and $18 million internationally. It has been a cult classic ever since. Night of the Living Dead was heavily criticized at its release for its explicit gore, but eventually garnered critical acclaim and has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry as a film deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."    
 Living Dead films (1978–2010) also directed by Romero, and has inspired remakes. 

== Plot summary == a strange shock and insanity as Ben drives the monsters from the house and seals the doors and windows.

 

Ben and Barbra are unaware that the farmhouse has a cellar, housing an angry married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), who sought refuge after a group of zombies overturned their car; and teenage couple Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley), who arrived after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal murders.  Karen has fallen seriously ill after being bitten by one of the zombies.  They venture upstairs when Ben turns on a radio, while Barbra awakens from a stupor. Harry demands that everyone hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a "deathtrap" and continues, upstairs, to barricade the house, with Toms help.

Radio reports explain that a state of mass murder is sweeping across the eastern United States. When Ben finds a television, the emergency broadcaster reports that the recently deceased have become reanimated and are consuming the flesh of the living. Experts, scientists, and the United States military fail to discover the cause, though one scientist suspects radioactive contamination from a space probe returning from Venus, which was deliberately exploded in the Earths atmosphere when the radiation was detected.
 

When the reports list local rescue centers offering refuge and safety, Ben plans to obtain medical care for Karen. Ben and Tom therefore refuel Bens truck, while Harry hurls Molotov cocktails from an upper window at the "undead". Fearing for Toms safety, Judy follows him. At the pump, Tom accidentally spills gasoline on the truck, setting it ablaze. Tom and Judy try to drive the truck away from the pump, but Judy is unable to free herself from its door, and the truck explodes, instantly killing Tom and Judy.
 posses of armed men are patrolling the countryside to restore order.

Moments later, the lights go out and the living dead break through the barricades. Harry grabs Bens rifle and threatens to shoot him, but Ben wrestles the gun away and fires.  Mortally wounded, Harry stumbles into the cellar and collapses next to Karen, who has also died from her illness. The undead try to pull Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself and goes down into the cellar, to find a reanimated Karen eating Harry. Helen, paralyzed by shock, falls as Karen stabs her to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the living dead, is carried away by the horde and devoured. The undead overrun the house, and Ben seals himself inside the cellar (ironically, the course of action he originally argued against), where he finds Harry and Helen starting to reanimate and shoots them.

The next morning, Ben is awakened by the gunshots of sheriffs deputies killing all the zombies they find.  Venturing upstairs, he is killed by a member of the posse.  The film ends with a series of still shots as Ben is placed onto a burning pyre, along with other dead bodies.

== Cast ==
 .]]
*  " (in real life, a distinguished gentleman and former university professor), according to a movie reviewer in 1969.  Casting Jones as the hero was, in 1968, potentially controversial. At the time, it was not typical for a black man to be the hero of a U.S. film when the rest of the cast was composed of white actors; but Romero said that Jones "simply gave the best audition". George A. Romero, quoted in Jones, Rough Guide to Horror Movies, p. 118.  After Night of the Living Dead, he was in a few other films, and continued as a theater actor and director until his death in 1988.  Despite his other film roles, Jones worried that people only recognized him as Ben.  House of Wax (1953). Besides acting, ODea performed her own stunts, which she jokingly claimed amounted to "lots of running". Assessing Night of the Living Dead, she stated "I honestly had no idea it would have such a lasting impact on our culture". She was just as surprised by the renown the film brought her: "People treat you differently.   ho-hum Judy ODea until they realize   Barbra from Night of the Living Dead. All of a sudden   not so ho-hum anymore!"

Romeros friends and acquaintances were recruited as zombie extra (actor)|extras. Romero stated, "We had a film company doing commercials and industrial films so there were a lot of people from the advertising game who all wanted to come out and be zombies, and a lot of them did." He adds amusingly, "Some people from around Evans City who just thought it was a goof came out to get caked in makeup and lumber around." 

== Production ==

=== Development and pre-production === industrial films John Russo and Russell Streiner. During this period, the trio grew bored making commercials and wanted to film a horror movie. According to Romero, they wanted to capitalize on the film industrys "thirst for the bizarre". Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at  . Retrieved June 24, 2006.  He and Streiner contacted Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, president and vice president respectively of a Pittsburgh-based industrial film firm called Hardman Associates, Inc., and pitched their idea for a then-untitled horror film. Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at  .  Convinced by Romero, a production company called Image Ten was formed which included Romero, Russo, Streiner, Hardman and Eastman. The initial budget was $6,000 with the ten members of the production company investing $600 each for a share of the profits. When it was found that another $6,000 was required another ten investors were found but this was also soon found to be inadequate. Image Ten eventually raised approximately $114,000 for the budget.

=== Writing === Day of the Dead (1985) were adapted from the two remaining parts. 
 I Am plague that ravages a futuristic Los Angeles. The infected in I Am Legend become vampire-like creatures and prey on the uninfected.    Discussing the creation of Night of the Living Dead, Romero remarked, "I had written a short story, which I basically had ripped off from a Richard Matheson novel called I Am Legend."  Romero further explained:

 
 The Last I Am Legend. Matheson was not impressed by Romeros interpretation, feeling that "It was ... kind of cornball",  though he later said, "George Romeros a nice guy, though. I dont harbor any animosity toward him".  Critic Danél Griffin remarked, "Romero freely admits that his film was a direct rip-off of Mathesons novel; I would be a little less harsh in my description and say that Romero merely expanded the authors ideas with deviations so completely original that   is expelled from being labeled a true rip-off". 

Russo and Romero revised the screenplay while filming. Karl Hardman attributed the edits to lead actor Duane Jones:
 

Eastman modified cellar scenes featuring dialogue between Helen and Harry Cooper.  According to lead actress Judith ODea, much of the dialogue was Improvisational theatre|improvised. She told an interviewer, "I dont know if there was an actual working script! We would go over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each felt it should be done". Judith ODea interview, in Collum, Assault of the Killer Bs, p. 4.  One example offered by ODea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnnys death:

 

=== Filming ===

==== Principal photography ====
  Cemetery in 2007.]] Evans City, Butler County; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. The interior upstairs scenes were filmed in a downtown Evans City home that later became the offices of a prominent local physician and family doctor (Allsop). This home is still standing on South Washington St. (locally called Former state routes in Pennsylvania#PA 855|Mars-Evans City Road), between the intersecting streets of South Jackson and Van Buren. The cemetery chapel was under warrant for demolition; however, Gary R. Steiner led a successful effort to raise $50,000 to restore the building, and the chapel is currently undergoing renovations.

  black-and-white film. The completed film ultimately benefited from the decision, as film historian Joseph Maddrey describes the black-and-white filming as "guerrilla filmmaking|guerrilla-style", resembling "the unflinching authority of a wartime newsreel". Maddrey adds, it "seem  as much like a documentary on the loss of social stability as an exploitation film". 

==== Directing ====
Night of the Living Dead was the first feature-length film directed by George A. Romero. His initial work involved filming   (film noir style) lighting to emphasize humanitys nightmare alienation from itself".

The opening title music with the car on the road had been used in a 1961 episode of the TV series   entitled "Bullets Cost Too Much". Most of the music in the film had previously been used on the soundtrack for the science-fiction B movie|B-movie Teenagers from Outer Space (1959). The eerie musical piece during the tense scene in the film where Ben finds the rifle in the closet inside the farmhouse as the radio reports of mayhem play in the background can be heard in longer and more complete form during the opening credits and the beginning of The Devils Messenger (1961) starring Lon Chaney, Jr. Another piece, accompanying Barbras flight from the cemetery zombie, was taken from the score for The Hideous Sun Demon (1959). According to WRS, "We chose a selection of music for each of the various scenes and then George made the final selections. We then took those selections and augmented them electronically". Sound tech R. Lococos choices worked well, as Film historian Sumiko Higashi believes that the music "signifies the nature of events that await". 

Sound effects were created by WRS Studio in Pittsburgh. "Sound engineer Richard Lococo recorded all of the live sound effects used in the film". Lococo recalled, "Of all the sound effects that we created, the one that still gives me goose bumps when I hear it, is Marilyns screaming as   is killed by her daughter. Judy ODeas screaming is a close second. Both were looped in and out of echo over and over again".

== Controversy == MPAA film rating system was not in place until November 1968, so even young children were not prohibited from purchasing tickets. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film with such potent content for a horror film they were entirely unprepared for. "I dont think the younger kids really knew what hit them," he said. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and theyd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately: 

 

Response from Variety Film Reviews|Variety after the initial release reflects the outrage generated by Romeros film: "Until the Supreme Court establishes clear-cut guidelines for the pornography of violence, Night of the Living Dead will serve nicely as an outer-limit definition by example. In   mere 90 minutes this horror film (pun intended) casts serious aspersions on the integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers, distributor Walter Reade, the film industry as a whole and   who book  , as well as raising doubts about the future of the regional cinema movement and about the moral health of film goers who cheerfully opt for this unrelieved orgy of sadism..."

More than 40 years after its release, the film enjoys a reputation as a classic and still receives positive reviews; review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 52 reviews and gave Night of the Living Dead a 96% "Certified Fresh",  and it is regarded by many as one of the best films of 1968.    In 2008, the film was ranked by Empire (film magazine)|Empire magazine No. 397 of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.  The New York Times also placed the film on their Best 1000 Movies Ever list.  In January 2010, Total Film included the film on its list of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.  Rolling Stone magazine named Night of the Living Dead one of The 100 Maverick Movies in the Last 100 Years.  Readers digest found it to be the 12th scariest movie of all time.

=== Critical response ===
  
Reviewers disliked the films gory special effects. Variety (magazine)|Variety labeled Night of the Living Dead an "unrelieved orgy of Sadomasochism|sadism" and questioned the "integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers".  The New York Times critic Vincent Canby referred to the film as a "junk movie" as well as "spare, uncluttered, but really silly". 

Some reviewers cited the film as groundbreaking. Pauline Kael called the film "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made – and when you leave the theatre you may wish you could forget the whole horrible experience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The films grainy, banal seriousness works for it – gives it a crude realism". Pauline Kael, 5001 Nights at the Movies (Henry Holt and Company, 1991), ISBN 978-0-8050-1367-2 .  A Film Daily critic commented, "This is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper hit|sleeper."  While Roger Ebert criticized the matinée screening, he admitted that he "admires the movie itself".  Critic Rex Reed wrote, "If you want to see what turns a B movie into a classic   dont miss Night of the Living Dead. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it." 

 

Since the release, some critics and film historians have seen Night of the Living Dead as a subversive film that critiques 1960s American society, international   operations, helicopters, and graphic carnage.

 patriarchal nuclear family"  and "the flaws inherent in the media, local and federal government agencies, and the entire mechanism of civil defense".  Film historian Linda Badley explains that the film was so horrifying because the monsters were not creatures from outer space or some exotic environment, "Theyre us".  Romero confessed that the film was designed to reflect the tensions of the time: "It was 1968, man. Everybody had a message. The anger and attitude and all thats there is just because it was the Sixties. We lived at the farmhouse, so we were always into raps about the implication and the meaning, so some of that crept in". 

Other commentators, most notably Chris Iacovelli, assert that this is a film classic and should be praised for its ground-breaking and thought-provoking approach to bringing the discussion of humanity’s disregard and aversion to others outside their class/caste/ethnicity from the halls of academia and into the homes of mainstream America.

Due to the films perceived public domain status, several independent film companies have also done remakes of the film.  
*Night of the Living Dead: Resurrection (2012) - British director James Plumb made this remake set in Wales. 
*A Night of the Living Dead (2014) - Shattered Images Films and Cullen Park Productions released a remake with new twists and characters, written and directed by Chad Zuver.

== Copyright status == United States copyright law required a proper notice for a work to maintain a copyright.  Image Ten displayed such a notice on the title frames of the film beneath the original title, Night of the Flesh Eaters. The distributor removed the statement when it changed the title.  

A limited number of theatrical release prints were distributed by Walter Reade and these copies could have been shelved if Romero and Image Ten had elected to do so. This would have given Romero the opportunity to rename the film, do a few brief "creative" edits, and then obtain a new copyright. But this was never done and the theatrical releases continued to be distributed until eventually reprinted and distributed by home video distributors.

Because of the public domain status, the film is sold on home video by many distributors. As of 2012, the Amazon.com lists copies of Night of the Living Dead numbering 52 on VHS, 181 on DVD, and 9 on Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray.  The original film is available to view or download free on Internet sites, such as Internet Archive, Hulu, and YouTube.    As of February 11, 2015, it is the Internet Archives most-downloaded film, with over two million downloads.
