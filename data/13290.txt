==Plot==
  and Bud Cort]]
Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) is a young man obsessed with death. He stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his socialite mother (Vivian Pickles).   

At another strangers funeral service, Harold meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman who shares Harolds hobby of attending funerals. He is entranced by her quirky outlook on life, which is bright and excessively carefree in contrast with his morbidity. The pair form a bond and Maude slowly shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play banjo), and teaches him how to "  the most of his time on earth".  Meanwhile, Harolds mother is determined, against Harolds wishes, to find him a wife. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed dates, by appearing to commit gruesome acts such as self-immolation, self-mutilation and seppuku.
 romance and sleeping pills and will be dead by midnight. She restates her firm belief that eighty is the proper age to die.

Harold rushes Maude to the hospital, where she is treated unsuccessfully and dies. In the final sequence, Harolds car is seen going off a seaside cliff but after the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo. After gazing down at the wreckage, he dances away, picking out on his banjo Cat Stevens "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out".

==Cast==
* Ruth Gordon as Dame Marjorie "Maude" Chardin, a 79-year-old free spirit who wears her hair in braids. Maude believes in living each day to its fullest, and "trying something new every day".  Her view of life is so joyful that, true to the films motif, it crosses a blurred, shifting line into a carefree attitude toward death as well. We know little of her past, except that as a young woman she lived in pre-war Vienna, was once married and has a Nazi concentration camp tattoo on one arm.
* Bud Cort as Harold Parker Chasen, a young man in his 20s who is obsessed with death. He drives a hearse, attends funerals of strangers and stages elaborate fake suicides. Through meeting and falling in love with Maude, he discovers joy in living for the first time.
* Vivian Pickles as Mrs. Chasen, Harold’s opulently wealthy mother, is controlling, snooty and seemingly incapable of affection. Hoping to force him into respectability, Mrs. Chasen replaces Harolds beloved hearse with a Jaguar (which he then converts to a miniature hearse) and sets up several blind dates, or more accurately, "bride interviews" with young women. It is clear that she will make the choice.
* Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, the sculptor who makes the ice statue of Maude and lends them his tools to transport a tree.
* Charles Tyner as General Victor Ball, Harolds uncle who lost an arm in the war and now pulls a hidden cord to make his wire prosthetic "salute". On Mrs. Chasens orders, he attempts to prepare Harold to join the armed forces. The effort is thwarted by a stunt, in which Harold appears to kill Maude.
* Ellen Geer as Sunshine Doré, an actress. On Harold’s third blind date, she mimics his suicide, giving a histrionic rendition of Juliets death scene.
* Eric Christmas as Priest
* G. Wood as Psychiatrist
* Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Harolds first blind date, whom he scares off by apparently setting himself on fire.
* Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Harolds second blind date, whom he dissuades by pretending to cut off his hand.
* Tom Skerritt (credited as "M. Borman") as Motorcycle Officer
* Director Hal Ashby appears in an uncredited cameo, watching a model train at an amusement park. The amusement park is Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk (California USA) / Penny Arcade.

==Production== Stanley Jaffe at Paramount. Higgins sold the script with the understanding that he would direct the film but he was told he wasnt ready, after tests he shot proved unsatisfactory to the studio heads. Ashby would only commit to directing the film after getting Higgins blessing and then, so Higgins could watch and learn from him on the set, Ashby made Higgins a co-producer.  Higgins says he originally thought of the story as a play. It then became a 20 minute thesis while at film school. After the film came out, the script was turned into a novel then a play, which ran for several years in Paris. 

Ashby felt that Maude should ideally be European and his list of possible actresses included dames Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans, Gladys Cooper and Celia Johnson as well as Lotte Lenya, Luise Rainer, Pola Negri, Minta Durfee and Agatha Christie.  Ruth Gordon indicated that in addition she heard that Edwige Feuillere, Elisabeth Bergner, Mildred Natwick, Mildred Dunnock and Dorothy Stickney had been considered. 
 John Savage. Also on his list were John Rubinstein, for whom Higgins had written the part and then up-and-coming British pop star Elton John, whom Ashby had seen live and hoped would also do the music. 

Anne Brebner, the casting director, was almost cast as Harolds mother, when Vivian Pickles was briefly unable to do the role. Brebner, Anne (guest); Morrison, John (Host) (May 6, 2011).  . blip.tv. Retrieved 2011-09-08. 

==Themes== Auschwitz Identification ID number tattooed on her arm, as well as her talk with Harold about using an umbrella to defend herself from thugs at political meetings before moving to America. Part of what has made the film a classic is that Ashby understands and is sympathetic of both the doomed and optimistic outlooks rather than portraying the world as Us vs. Them. This is a love story of two people, Harold and Maude.

Meaning threads through the film as does choice mostly seen through the changes in Harold. He is part of a society in which he is of no importance; existentially, he is without meaning. Maude lives a life of deliberate choice and rich with meaning. It is in this crisis, shown against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, that we see the differences between experiencing a meaningless war and experiencing and living beyond a war of great meaning. He is part of a generation and she an individual. He no longer believes in anything while she lives the ideals of the eras youth culture. He plays with death, she accepts death as a fact of life and decides her own time to die. 

Because he is forced to accept that deliberate choice Harold gains the strength to make his own. He wont react to a society that sees him only as a position he fills or the background of a meaningless world. He, too will be an individual, he will live a life with meaning. 

===Harolds "deaths"===
When Harold and Maude are talking candidly at her home he tells her that he has "died a few times".  He describes how, when he was at boarding school, he set his chemistry lab on fire and escaped through a hole in the floor, going home believing his school career was at an end and he was free. When the police came to his house, Harold watched as they told his mother that he had died in the fire and saw her collapse into the policemens arms. As he reaches this part of the story, Harold bursts into tears and declares, "I decided then I enjoyed being dead".

Throughout the movie, Harold "dies" seven to eight times. He tells his psychologist at one early juncture that he has made similar attempts in all fifteen times now, which he calls a rough estimate.

# Hanging himself in opening scene: Harold hangs himself while his mother is on the phone. She barely seems to notice this display (at one point she tells him, "I suppose you think thats very funny, Harold.") and continues her conversation.
# Letting his mother find him in her bathtub, throat and wrists slit and the mirrors drenched in blood: After this act, Harold sees a psychiatrist.
# Floating dead in pool: Harold floats face down, fully clothed, for an impossibly long time as his mother swims laps past him. Camera shots from below establish that he has no breathing apparatus.
# Shooting himself in the forehead: As his mother reads the questionnaire for the dating service (and answers it according to her preferences, not his), Harold surreptitiously loads a revolver with live rounds, then wheels around and points it at his mother. When after several moments she still does not notice, he turns around and shoots himself. As the blast sends him toppling backward with a hole in his forehead, his mother snaps, "Harold! Please!" and calmly continues with the questionnaire.
# Self-immolation: For the first blind date, Harold sets himself on fire on the diving board in view of the horrified girl, then calmly walks in behind her, with his body still apparently burning outside the window.
# Hand chopping: The second blind date ends abruptly, with Harold chopping off an obviously fake hand. This is the incident that makes his mother decide to send him to the military.
#  , she tests the blade with one hand to see its retraction and plunges the fake blade into her chest and acts out a death scene. At that instant, Harolds mother enters and seeing what she presumes is a dead girl, declares indignantly, "Harold! That was your last date!"
# Car wreck: Grief-stricken over Maudes death, Harold drives his Jaguar/hearse recklessly up a winding dirt road, sending it flying off a cliff to the rocks below. When the camera tilts from the wreckage up the cliff face, we find Harold standing at the top. He calmly begins to play the banjo Maude gave him and slowly dances away.

===Critical response=== dark humor. Roger Ebert, in a review dated January 1, 1972, did not care for the film. He wrote, "And so what we get, finally, is a movie of attitudes. Harold is death, Maude life, and they manage to make the two seem so similar that lifes hardly worth the extra bother. The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell. Nothing more to report today. Harold doesnt even make pallbearer."  Vincent Canby also panned the film, stating that the actors "are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting, that Harold and Maude are obviously made for each other, a point the movie itself refuses to recognize with a twist ending that betrays, I think, its life-affirming pretensions." 

The reputation of the film has increased; Rotten Tomatoes, which labeled the film as "Certified Fresh", gave it a score of 86% based on 42 reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10. A consensus on the site read, "Hal Ashbys comedy is too dark and twisted for some, and occasionally oversteps its bounds, but theres no denying the films warm humor and big heart." {{cite web
