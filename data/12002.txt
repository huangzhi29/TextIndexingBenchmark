 Godzilla series featured the return of Godzillas greatest foe, the three-headed King Ghidorah. Tomoyuki Tanaka had originally desired to create new monster opponents for the series, but after the box office disappointment of 1989s Godzilla vs Biollante Tanaka opted to bring back classic foes instead. The film was a box office hit with sequels released on a yearly basis until 1995. It won a Japanese Academy Award for special effects.

==Plot== hydrogen bomb test and Terasawa believes that the radiation from the bomb eventually mutated the dinosaur into the second Godzilla which first appeared in 1984.
 UFO lands travel back in time to 1944 and remove Godzillasaurus from Lagos, thereby erasing the second Godzilla from existence. As proof of their story, Emmy presents to the Japanese government a copy of Terasawas book which hasnt even been written yet.
 Dorats on Lagos. After the subsequent nuclear test in 1954, the three creatures absorb the radiation and fuse into King Ghidorah, who takes Godzillas place in history. In the present, the Futurians use King Ghidorah to subjugate Japan and issue an ultimatum, but Japan refuses to surrender.

Feeling sympathy for the Japanese, Emmy reveals the truth behind the Futurians mission: in the future, Japan became an economic superpower that surpassed the United States, Russia, and China. The Futurians stole the time machine and plan to use King Ghidorah to alter the future by devastating present day Japan and prevent Japans future economic dominance over the world. After Emmy is returned to her ship by M-11, she reprograms the android. With M-11 and Terasawas aid, Emmy sabotages Ghidorahs control in the UFO. However, Emmys companions reveal that their ship is bound to automatically return to the future in the event of sabotage, allowing them to return to a future where Japan has been destroyed either way.

Meanwhile, Shindo believes that Godzilla can be recreated using radiation from his nuclear submarine. While on its mission, however, the submarine is destroyed by Godzilla. Terasawa learns from newspaper archives that a Russian nuclear submarine sank in the 1970s near the island that Godzillasaurus was teleported to and gave off enough radiation to mutate the dinosaur into the Godzilla who attacked Tokyo in 1984.
 Japanese troops attack Godzilla in Sapporo to no avail. Godzilla then turns his attention on Tokyo, destroying the metropolis and killing Shindo in the process.

Emmy travels to the future and returns with King Ghidorah|Mecha-King Ghidorah, a resurrected cyborg version of the original creature. Emmy relentlessly blasts Godzilla with Ghidorahs beams, but unfortunately proved useless. Godzilla then counters by relentlessly blasting the mecha with his own atomic ray, nearly decapitating Mecha King Ghidorah. However, Emmy counters again, this time managing to knock Godzilla down. Godzilla yet proved to be too resilient, that he knocked Mecha Ghidorah down easily. Emmy had no choice, but to carry Godzilla off and drops the monster along with Ghidorah into the ocean. Emmy then returns to the future in the time shuttle but not before informing Terasawa that she is in fact a descendant of his.

At the bottom of the sea, Godzilla recovers and roars over Mecha-King Ghidorahs remains.

==Production==
This film is set after the events of The Return of Godzilla (1984) and Godzilla vs. Biollante (1989). Originally, the film was to be a remake of King Kong vs. Godzilla with the title Godzilla vs. King Kong, but Turner Entertainment demanded too much money for the use of King Kong (Toho)|Kong.  After this, Toho had the idea of making Godzilla vs. Mechani-Kong (from 1967s King Kong Escapes), but director Kazuki Omori feared that this would ultimately violate Turners copyright as well.  Toho eventually settled for Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, pitting Godzilla against his archenemy from the original series.
