 Godzilla series, this was the first of two island-themed adventure films starring Godzilla.

The film was released direct to television in the United States in 1967 by the Walter Reade organization as Godzilla versus The Sea Monster.

==Plot==
After Yata (Toru Ibuki) is lost at sea, his brother Ryota (Toru Watanabe) steals a yacht with his two friends and a bank robber, the crew runs afoul of the giant lobster Ebirah, and washes up on the shore of an island, where a terrorist organization manufactures heavy water for their purposes, as well as a chemical that keeps Ebirah at bay. The organization, known as the Red Bamboo, has enslaved natives from Infant Island to help them, but the natives hope to awaken Mothra (now a full-grown moth metamorphosed from the larva that appeared in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster) to rescue them.

In their efforts to avoid capture, Ryota and his friends, aided by a beautiful native girl, stumble across Godzilla sleeping within a cliffside cavern. The group devises a plan to defeat the Red Bamboo and escape from the island. In the process, they wake Godzilla using a lightning rod. Godzilla fights Ebirah, but the giant crustacean escapes. Godzilla is then attacked by a giant condor and a squadron of Red Bamboo fighter jets, but destroys them.

The humans retrieve the missing Yata, free the enslaved natives and Godzilla begins to destroy the base. Godzilla smashes a tower that has a self-destruct button that makes the island unstable. Godzilla fights Ebirah and defeats it, ripping off both Ebirahs claws and causing it to retreat into the sea. The natives summon Mothra to save everyone, however, Godzilla challenges Mothra when she gets to the island. Mothra manages to push Godzilla away and carry the people off. Godzilla escapes the island just before it explodes.

==Production==

The film was originally written for King Kong (the project was tentatively
titled Operation Robinson Crusoe:King Kong vs Ebirah), but Toho switched Kong with another popular character at the time, Godzilla. This explains why Godzilla displays uncharacteristic behavior in the film, such as drawing strength from electricity, its curiosity to Kumi Mizunos character, the usage of boulders to destroy the Red Bamboo Base, and its hostilities with Mothra (despite them now being allies). Toho would later use Kong for King Kong Escapes.

The US television version and early video versions have a different opening to the film. The opening scenes of Ryota at the Maritime Safety Agency searching for news of his brother have been replaced with a scene supposedly showing Ebirah destroying Yatas boat. This sequence was created by editing a later scene in the movie. The current DVD version of the film restores the Japanese cut.

In 1991, Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster was distributed under the Film Ventures International name. The company replaced the opening with a generic credit sequence, using footage from Son of Godzilla. This version was aired on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

==English version==
In 1967, the film was released directly to television in North America by the Walter Reade Organization. It was the first Godzilla film to not receive North American theatrical distribution. As with Walter Reade Organizations next Godzilla release, Son of Godzilla, this movie was dubbed by Titra Studios.

There were several alterations made for this release:
* Captain Ryuuis name was changed to Yamoto. Ebirah and the Red Bamboo are never named.
* Deleted: The opening credits sequence. This version features only the title card, Godzilla versus The Sea Monster.
* Altered: 30 seconds of Ebirahs attack on the Yahlen were shifted to the beginning of the film, standing in for Yatas unseen shipwreck.
* Deleted: A scene where Ryota goes to the Maritime Safety office and sees a poster on the wall for a dance contest.
* Deleted: Yoshimura thinking up a plan with Nita and Ichino to turn the Yahlen around through cooperation with Ryota. High and Low was removed during Godzillas battle with the Red Bamboo airforce.
* Deleted: Several scenes of the natives of Infant Island praying to Mothra during the third act were removed.

The English version runs 83 minutes, four minutes shorter than the Japanese version.
 international version, which is uncut. The dubbing in this version is often cited as inferior to the original Titra Studios dub.

* Godzilla, Ebirah, Mothra: Great Battle in the South Seas - Translated Japanese title.

* Ebirah, Horror of the Deep - Tohos official English title, and UK home video title.

* Godzilla versus The Sea Monster - Original U.S. dub title. The only English Godzilla title where "versus" is spelled out.
