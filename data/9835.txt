The films total budget was estimated to be $6 million.  It was a commercial hit, grossing $25,244,700.  It has since become a cult film.

==Plot== mines to third world war. However, during late 1990s, fighting has lessened as countries become more willing to negotiate peace. 
 Frank Doubleday), the right-hand man of the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), who warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage and that they have 24 hours to meet their sole demand: to allow all the Manhattan inmates access to the mainland. Should this not be granted, the President will be executed. Defeated, the security forces withdraw from Manhattan.

New York Police Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) offers a deal to a United States Special Operations Forces|U.S special forces soldier turned rebel "Snake" Plissken (Kurt Russell), who was convicted of attempting to rob the Federal Reserve. If Snake rescues the President and retrieves a cassette tape containing a vital speech within 24 hours, Hauk will give him a full pardon. When Plissken reluctantly agrees to attempt the rescue, Hauk has him injected with a "booster" he says is to fend off disease, but the tech performing the injection forces Hauk to reveal the injection implanted microscopic explosives that will rupture his carotid arteries within 22 hours. The explosives can only be defused in the last 15 minutes before they detonate, ensuring that Snake does not abandon his mission (Hauk predicted the idea of Snake possibly pulling the glide away from Manhattan and flying to Canada). If he returns with the President and the tape in time for the summit, Hauk will save him from his death by neutralizing the explosives with X-rays.

Snake is escorted by guards to the wall and is sent into Manhattan in a stealth glider, landing atop the World Trade Center. He locates the plane wreckage and escape pod and tracks the Presidents life-monitor bracelet signal to a vaudeville theatre, only to find it on the wrist of an old man. He meets an inmate nicknamed "Cabbie" (Ernest Borgnine), who drives a cab with bars over the windows and transports inmates over Manhattan, and who takes Snake to see Harold "Brain" Hellman (Harry Dean Stanton), a powerful Manhattan mobster who has made the New York Public Library his personal fortress, with inmates to protect it and an oil rig set up in the library to provide oil and fuel (likely for protected status in the prison).
 Railroad 69th Street Bridge, with Duke as the leader using the President as a human shield and a map Brain himself has created to avoid the mines in order to leave Manhattan. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) to lead him to the Dukes compound at Grand Central Station. Snake finds the President in a railroad car, but he is captured by the Dukes men who noticed him.

While Snake is forced to fight to the death with a heavy prisoner named Slag (Ox Baker), Brain and Maggie trick Romero into letting them see the President. Once inside, they kill Romero and the guards, free the President, and flee. As Snake wins the fight, the Duke learns of Brains treachery and rounds up his gang to chase them down, desperate to leave Manhattan. In the confusion, Snake slips away and manages to catch up with Brain, Maggie, and the President on the roof of the World Trade Center, intending to use Snakes glider to escape New York. After a group of crazies cuts the ropes on Snakes glider and push it off the top of the roof, the group heads back down and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge in his cab. When Cabbie reveals that he has the secret tape (having traded it to Romero earlier for his cabbies hat), the President demands it, but Snake keeps it.

With the Duke chasing in another car, Snake and the others drive over the mine-strewn bridge. The cab is blown in half by a miscalculation of the land mine placement and Cabbie is killed. As they flee on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine and Maggie refuses to leave him, taking Snakes gun and firing several shots at the Dukes approaching car before he runs her over. Snake and the President reach the wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke kills the guards and attacks Snake, but the President, from atop the wall, shoots the Duke dead with an M16 rifle, mocking him as he does so. Snake is lifted to safety, and the explosives are deactivated with just seconds to spare.

As the President prepares for a televised speech, he thanks Snake for saving him. Snake asks how he feels about the people who died saving his life, but the President only offers halfhearted regret. Hauk offers Snake a job, but Snake just walks away. The Presidents speech commences, and he offers the content of the cassette to the summit; but to the Presidents surprise and public humiliation, the tape has been switched for Cabbies cassette of the swing song "Bandstand Boogie". As Snake walks away, he removes the real cassette from his pocket and tears out the magnetic tape.

==Development== Death Wish, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this films philosophy but liked how it conveyed "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science fiction film along these lines". 

===Casting=== Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as "a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Clint Eastwood|Eastwoods vocal-ness."  All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is "the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is." Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program in order to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the "lightweight" Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.   

===Pre-production=== Dark Star The Philadelphia The Shape" in Halloween. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the films ending. 

The films setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on only a shoe-string budget. He and the films production designer Joe Alves rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but Alves nixed that idea "because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot." {{cite news | last = Beeler

===Production===
Carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. "Wed finish shooting at about 6 am and Id just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. Id wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." 

The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a   bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape."  In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, in order to utilize their then Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. 

When it came to shooting in New York City, Carpenter managed to persuade federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasnt easy to get that initial permission. Theyd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble."   

Carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England."

 wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. What appears on those screens was not computer-generated. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics which were very expensive at the time, even for such a simple animation. To get the animation he wanted, the effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a 3D wireframe animation. 

==Reception==
Escape from New York grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981.  The film received generally positive reviews. As of April 2013, it has a rating of 83% on  , in his review for the New York Times, wrote, "  is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. Its a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season."  However, in his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr, wrote "it fails to satisfy–it gives us too little of too much." 

Cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his novel Neuromancer. "I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didnt you? It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot." {{cite news

Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: "After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didnt really start until Snake got to New York. It wasnt necessary to show what sent him there."    The film has been released on the UMD format for Sonys PlayStation Portable.

===Anime===
Carpenter was planning an anime spin-off of Escape from New York, with Outlaw Star s Mitsuru Hongo slated to direct.  However, nothing new has emerged since that announcement.

==Sequel==
 
A sequel, Escape from L.A., was released in 1996, with Carpenter returning along with Russell, now also acting as producer and co-writer.

==Remake== Neal Moritz was to produce and Ken Nolan was to write the screenplay which would combine an original story for Plissken with the story from the 1981 film, although Carpenter hinted that the film might be a prequel. 

New Line Cinema (one-time video distributor of the original) acquired the rights to the film from co-rights holder StudioCanal, who will control the European rights, and Carpenter, who will serve as an executive producer and said, "Snake is one of my fondest creations. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, and it would be fun to see someone else try."  Russell has commented on the remake and on the casting of Butler as Plissken, saying, "I will say that when I was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was Oh, man!  . I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American." {{cite news | last = Nashawaty | first = Chris | coauthors =
