Portions of the film were shot in Goblin Valley State Park, Utah, USA, and non-humanoid creatures were created by Stan Winston Studio from designs by Crash McCreery, Chris Swift, Gerald Brom|Brom, Bernie Wrightson, and Simon Bisley.

The film parodies classic science fiction films, the television series  , and others, as well as related media activities such as fandom. It stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell as the cast of a defunct television series called Galaxy Quest, in which the crew of a spaceship embarked on intergalactic adventures. Enrico Colantoni also stars as the leader of an alien race who ask the actors for help, believing the shows adventures were real. The films supporting cast features Robin Sachs as the warlord Sarris and Patrick Breen as a friendly alien. Justin Long makes his feature film debut as an obsessed fan of the television show.

 Klaatu Nebula". octopoidal creatures using a device that makes them appear human. Technologically advanced but having no concept of fiction, they have mistaken broadcasts of Galaxy Quest for historical documentaries and impressed by the idealized presentation, modeled their society on the ethos presented in the episodes. They have invented and built real versions of the technologies portrayed in the show, including the Protector.

The Thermians transport Jason onto the Protector to negotiate with Sarris, a reptilian humanoid warlord waging a genocidal war against the Thermian people. Sarris demands the Omega 13, a device used at the end of Galaxy Quest s final episode. Still believing the situation is fictional, Jason casually orders the Thermians to fire upon Sarriss spaceship and then insists on returning home but when they teleport him through space to Earth, he finally realizes the events were real. The Thermians then come back to Earth and ask for more help negotiating a surrender with Sarris.  Jason, believing Sarris is the one surrendering, asks his co-stars to join him and they agree, believing that the mission is just an acting job. Once the actors are aboard the Protector, they realize the truth but Sarris prevents them from leaving, so they assume their television roles, to save the Thermians.

The actors are not competent at controlling a real spaceship and their encounter with Sarris goes poorly. They escape by flying through a minefield, which damages the beryllium sphere that powers the ships reactor. The actors acquire a new sphere from a nearby planet after battling various alien creatures but when they return to the ship, Sarris has boarded it and taken control. Sarris interrogates Jason about the Omega 13 and forces him to admit the truth about Galaxy Quest to Mathesar, leader of the Thermians, who is heartbroken, equating fiction with deception and lies. Sarriss men activate the ships self-destruct but Jason and Alexander use a gambit from one of the shows episodes to kill the aliens guarding them.
 communicators that he accidentally swapped at a promotional store opening. Brandon and his friends use their extensive knowledge of the ship to help Jason and Gwen abort the self-destruct. Brandon also explains that, while some people believe the Omega 13 was a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe, he and others believe it is a time machine that sends its user 13 seconds into the past – "enough time to redeem a single mistake," as Jason observes.

With Jason in command of the Protector, the actors and Thermians destroy Sarris ship and set course back to Earth. Sarris sneaks aboard the Protector and starts killing the crew but Jason activates the Omega 13, is sent back in time 13 seconds and thwarts his attack. As the Thermians take control of the ship, the actors detach the command deck and land on Earth with Brandons help, accidentally crashing into the building where the Galaxy Quest convention is taking place. They emerge from the wreck to enthusiastic applause from the audience, who assume the crash is part of the entertainment; when Sarris exits from the wreckage and attacks again, Jason disintegrates him with a blaster pistol and receives even greater applause. Later that year Galaxy Quest is revived, starring the original cast, along with Laliari, a female Thermian who chose to stay on Earth with Fred and with Guy playing a new role as the ships chief of security.

==Cast==
 , Alan Rickman, Tim Allen, Daryl Mitchell, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub]]
* Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, the actor who played Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, the captain of the Protector on the fictional series. Jason remains the putative leader of the Galaxy Quest crew members as they travel to conventions and strip mall dedications. Hes prone to removing his shirt at the slightest pretext and is said to have had romantic relations with most of the minor female characters who appeared throughout his television career. Underneath his happy-go-lucky personality and mild egotism, however, he is depressed and feels helpless after being unable to get an equally acclaimed role after his definitive one as Taggart. His meta-fictional roles name is a reference to Peter Quince, the leader of a group of actors in Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream.
* Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco, the actress who played Lt. Tawny Madison, the Computer Officer of the Protector, who performed communication duties. As the shows female sex symbol, Tawnys job consists largely of repeating communications to and from the computer. Weaver later compared her meta-fictional role as Tawny to her role as Ellen Ripley in the Alien (film)|Alien series, describing Tawny as "a stereotypical dumb blonde" who fulfills a useless function in contrast to Ripleys dynamic centrality,  a fact of which DeMarco is aware and bitterly resents, being a far more assertive woman outside of her character. Its implied (and believed by enthusiastic female fans at the convention) that Gwen and Jason are romantically interested in each other, though they wont bring themselves to admit it.
*   to the point of being forced to wear his characters prosthetic headgear at public appearances. He is the last of the actors to embrace his television role (in order to satisfy the Thermians) and only does so when Quellek (a Thermian who idolizes Dr. Lazarus) dies in his arms.
* Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, the actor who played Tech Sgt. Chen. Chen is in charge of the engine room and the operator of the "digital conveyor" (akin to the Star Trek Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter). He acts in a detached manner and is completely unfazed by the strange events that occur. He is a loyal friend to all his coworkers, even Jason. When he saw Gwen upset over a past interview, he asked what her role was (as the interviewer didnt care to ask) to make her feel better. He is the only actor to not be terrified by the experience of transporting through space, merely commenting "That was a hell of a thing." Unlike the other actors, he thoroughly enjoys the entire experience, except for one brief moment of panic over using the digital conveyor. He is completely comfortable with the true form of the aliens; he even falls in love with Laliari.
* Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, an actor who had a minor role as a disposable and apparently unnamed character (see Redshirt (character)|redshirt) in a single episode of the original series. Guy has become a "Questerian" (akin to Trekkie), and is an emcee at the 18th annual Galaxy Quest Convention, greeting the actors familiarly even though they dont recognize him. He spends most of the movie fretting about his imminent demise, which he believes is inevitable for minor characters such as his, showing a difficulty to separate reality from fiction when in (perceived) danger. Ironically, he suffers the fewest injuries of any of the actors during their adventure. At times his fears based on fiction cliché turn out to be reasonable, as when he prevents Gwen from approaching apparently harmless childlike aliens, who are subsequently revealed to be hostile, sadistic and even cannibalistic. In reaction to this, he exclaims "Didnt you guys ever watch the show?" Guy finally overcomes his fears and decides its better to go out in a blaze of glory since he is supposed to die anyway, but Fred encourages him to think of himself as the "plucky comic relief." In the reboot of Galaxy Quest, he plays the new role of Security Chief "Roc" Ingersoll.
* Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber / Lt. Laredo, a parody of child prodigy characters, who has aged considerably since his role. His role as Laredo is essentially that of a pilot, but when he flies the real Protector out of the spaceport, he scrapes it against a wall and it takes him most of the film (and re-watching old Galaxy Quest episodes) to learn to do it properly. Corbin Bleu played Tommy at age 9 during the films introduction, footage from an original episode of the fictional series.
** Corbin Bleu as young Tommy Webber
* Enrico Colantoni as Mathesar, the leader of the Thermians. Mathesar is, like all of his people, an upright octopoid who appears as a white-skinned, gray-clad, black-haired human, speaks in stiff tones of voice, smiles warmly even when in sorrow or fear. As Sarris explains to Jason, Mathesar is incredibly naïve to the truth, as are the others of his crew; however, he remains very loyal to Nesmith and the other actors, still seeing them as heroes and praising the TV shows effects as "a very clever deception." In the end, he develops his own courage and becomes a hero himself, knocking out Sarris.
* Robin Sachs as Gen. Rothhar Sarris, a warlike humanoid insectoid-reptilian  who destroyed the Thermian home planet and most of their race, being bent on their destruction. He is cruel, unforgiving, deceitful and sadistic, taking pleasure from others pain. The character was named for film critic Andrew Sarris.
* Justin Long as Brandon, a devoted Galaxy Quest fan with an encyclopedic knowledge of the show. Jane Doe".
* Patrick Breen as Quellek, a Thermian who idolizes the Dr. Lazarus character. He assists Alexander but is initially brushed off by him, especially when he tries to repeat Lazarus catchphrase. He is later mortally wounded by one of Sarris men, and while dying, admits to Alexander he considered "Dr. Lazarus" a father figure, motivating Alexander to avenge him. Jeremy Howard as Kyle, a devout Galaxy Quest fan and Brandons friend. Samuel Lloyd as Neru, a Thermian crew member.
* Rainn Wilson as Lahnk, a Thermian engineer.
* J. P. Manoux as Excited alien
* Dian Bachar as Nervous tech
* Susan Egan (scenes deleted) as Teek

==Production== Mark Johnson, Home Fries director Dean Parisot to direct, but DreamWorks favored Harold Ramis over the latters experience. Ramis was hired in November 1998, but departed in February 1999 due to casting difficulties. He wanted Alec Baldwin for the lead role, who turned it down. Steve Martin and Kevin Kline were considered, though Kline turned it down due to family reasons. Ramis did not agree with the casting of Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, and Parisot took over as director within three weeks. After seeing the film, Ramis said he was ultimately impressed with Allens performance. 

Tony Shalhoub originally auditioned for Guy Fleegman, but Sam Rockwell won the part, and Shalhoub was cast as Fred Kwan instead. Rockwell almost backed out after winning the lead role in an independent film, but Kevin Spacey convinced him otherwise. Justin Long said he was nervous auditioning as an unknown actor at the time, competing against Kieran Culkin, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Tom Everett Scott for the part of Brandon. Paul Rudd auditioned for a role, while David Allen Grier was the second choice for Tommy Webber, and Jennifer Coolidge for Laliari.
