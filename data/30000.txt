==Production==
According to Scorsese, it was Brian De Palma who introduced him to Schrader. In Scorsese on Scorsese, the director talks about how much of the film arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He admits attempting to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state somewhere between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an "avenging angel" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites Alfred Hitchcocks The Wrong Man and Jack Hazans A Bigger Splash as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.

 Michael Chapman, would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot.

In writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of Arthur Bremer (who shot presidential candidate George Wallace in 1972)    and Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Notes from Underground. The writer also used himself as inspiration; prior to writing the screenplay, Schrader was in a lonely and alienated position, much like Bickle is. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. He wrote the script in under a month while staying in his former girlfriends apartment while she was away.

Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the national trauma of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickles paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening. Thus, Bickle chooses to drive his taxi anywhere in the city as a way to feed his hate. 
 Bernardo Bertoluccis 1900 (film)|1900 in Italy. According to Boyle, he would "finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ...   fly to New York." De Niro obtained a cab drivers license, and when on break would pick up a cab and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming 1900. De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of Arthur Bremer. When he had time off from shooting 1900, De Niro visited an army base in Northern Italy and tape-recorded soldiers from the Midwestern United States, whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Traviss character.
 Secret Service commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... we thought it was a good idea."

Jodie Foster was not the first choice to play Iris. Scorsese considered Melanie Griffith, Linda Blair, Bo Derek, and Carrie Fisher for the role. A newcomer, Mariel Hemingway, auditioned for the role but turned it down due to pressure from her family. After the other actresses turned down the role as well, Foster, an experienced child actor, was chosen.
 black roles. racist subtext, so they were changed to white roles.  Terminal Bar was featured in a scene in the film.   

Schrader originally set the film in Los Angeles, but it was moved to New York City because taxicabs were much more prevalent there than in Los Angeles. 

Taking place in an actual apartment, the tracking shot over the murder scene at the end took three months of preparation just because the production team had to cut through the ceiling in order to get it right. 

==Music==
The music by Bernard Herrmann was his final score before his death on December 24, 1975, and the film is dedicated to his memory. Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the "scum" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack—gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city—are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music. 

Also featured in the film is Jackson Brownes "Late for the Sky", appearing in a scene where couples are dancing on the program American Bandstand to the song as Travis watches on his small TV.

The soundtrack for the film, re-released in 1998 on CD, includes an expanded version of the score as well as the tracks from the original 1976 LP. It also features album notes by director Martin Scorsese, as well as full documentation for the tracks, linking them in great detail to individual takes. Track 12, "Diary of a Taxi Driver", features Herrmanns music with De Niros voice-over taken directly from the soundtrack.

Some of the tracks feature relatively long titles, representative of the fact that similar reprises are heard in many scenes.

Only the A-side of the 1976 soundtrack LP featured the Herrmann score. The B-side (tracks 14 through 18 on the CD) was dedicated to jazz "interpretations" of the score, arranged & conducted by Dave Blume. None of these recordings appeared in the film.

Some critics expressed concern over 13-year-old Fosters presence during the climactic shoot-out. Foster said that she was present during the setup and staging of the special effects used during the scene; the entire process was explained and demonstrated for her, step by step. Rather than being upset or traumatised, Foster said, she was fascinated and entertained by the behind-the-scenes preparation that went into the scene. In addition, before being given the part, Foster was subjected to psychological testing to ensure that she would not be emotionally scarred by her role, in accordance with California Labor Board requirements.

==Interpretations==
Sabine Haenni, a professor at Cornell University, commented on the film in her article "Geographies of Desire: Postsocial Urban Space and Historical Revision in the Films of Martin Scorsese" pg. 67: "While Taxi Driver chronicles Traviss excessive response to the perceived decline of the city, perhaps more fundamentally, the decline of the city seems to engender the decline of the male hero—Traviss inability to function in individual, collective, and heteronormative terms." 

Roger Ebert has written of the films ending: 
"There has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Traviss heroism of saving Iris, and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorseses characters." 
 

  has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl."  

On the Laserdisc audio commentary, Scorsese acknowledged several Film criticism|critics interpretation of the films ending as being Bickles dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that Bickle might fall into rage and recklessness in the future, and he is like "a ticking time bomb."  Writer Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis "is not cured by the movies end," and that "hes not going to be a hero next time."  When asked on the website Reddit about the films ending, Schrader said that it was not to be taken as a dream sequence, but that he envisioned it as returning to the beginning of the film—as if the last frame "could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again."

Roger Ebert instantly praised it as one of the greatest films he had ever seen, claiming:  "Taxi Driver" is a hell, from the opening shot of a cab emerging from stygian clouds of steam to the climactic killing scene in which the camera finally looks straight down. Scorsese wanted to look away from Traviss rejection; we almost want to look away from his life. But hes there, all right, and hes suffering.

==Legacy==
Taxi Driver,  , BBC Radio 4s Film Programme, 10 August 2007]     The film also influenced the Charles Winkler film You Talkin to Me? 

In the 2012 film Seven Psychopaths, psychotic Los Angeles actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) believes himself to be the illegitimate son of Travis Bickle. 

Travis also appears as a minor supporting character in the 2012 graphic novel  .

In the Canadian television series Trailer Park Boys, a man dressed as Travis makes an appearance in the episode "Jim Lahey is a Drunk Bastard", during the trailer park supervisor election.

=== "You talkin to me?" === pop culture mainstay. In 2005, it was ranked number 10 on the American Film Institutes AFIs 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes. 

In the corresponding scene, Bickle is looking into a mirror at himself, imagining a confrontation that would give him a chance to draw his gun. He says:

 

Roger Ebert called it "the truest line in the film.... Travis Bickles desperate need to make some kind of contact somehow—to share or mimic the effortless social interaction he sees all around him, but does not participate in." 

Schrader does not take credit for the line, saying that his script only read, "Travis speaks to himself in the mirror", and that De Niro improvised the dialogue. However, Schrader went on to say that De Niros performance was inspired by a routine by "an underground New York comedian" whom he had once seen, possibly including his signature line.

A Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray was released on April 5, 2011 to commemorate the films 35th anniversary. It includes the special features from the previous 2-disc collectors edition, plus an audio commentary by Scorsese released in 1991 for The Criterion Collection, previously released on Laserdisc.

==Sequel/remake==
In late January 2005, a sequel was announced by De Niro and Scorsese.    At a 25th-anniversary screening of Raging Bull, De Niro talked about the story of an older Travis Bickle being in development. Also in 2000, De Niro mentioned interest in bringing back the character in conversation with Actors Studio host James Lipton.    In November 2013, he revealed Schrader did a first draft but both him and Scorsese thought it wasnt good enough to go beyond.   

At the Berlinale 2010, De Niro, Scorsese, and Lars von Trier announced plans to work on a remake of Taxi Driver. The film will be produced in a similar manner to von Triers The Five Obstructions.   

In December 2011, Scorsese was interviewed about combining his passion for 3D as a new medium with the legacy of older films, and said, "If I could go back in time, Id shoot Taxi Driver in 3D. Bob De Niro in the mirror as Travis Bickle. Imagine how intimidating. You talking to me? You talking to me? Amazing possibilities."
