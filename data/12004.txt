}} science fiction kaiju film directed by Ishirō Honda. The film stars Akira Takarada, Momoko Kōchi, Akihiko Hirata, Takashi Shimura and Haruo Nakajima, who portrayed the titular character until his retirement in 1972. The film is produced by Toho and features special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya.
 monster resurrected by repeated nuclear tests in the Pacific, who ravages Japan and reignites the horrors of nuclear devastation to the very nation that experienced it first-hand. It was the first of many kaiju films released in Japan, paving the way and setting the standard for future kaiju films, many of which feature Godzilla. The film received universal critical acclaim and was a large box office success in Japan.

In 1956, TransWorld Releasing Corp. released Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, a heavily re-edited "Americanized"     version of the original film which featured new footage, featuring Canadian actor Raymond Burr, shot exclusively for its North American release. In 2004 Rialto Pictures gave the original a limited theatrical release in the United States to coincide with the original films 50th anniversary.

==Plot==
 
When a Japanese fishing boat is destroyed near Odo Island, another ship is sent to investigate only to meet the same fate with few survivors. Reporters arrive on Odo Island to further investigate. A village elder tells one of the reporters that he believes the poor fishing and ship disasters are being caused by an ancient sea creature known as "Godzilla". That same night, an unseen force comes ashore during a storm and attacks the village.

Paleontologist Kyohei Yamane leads an investigation crew to the island, where giant radioactive footprints and a trilobite are discovered. An alarm rings and Yamane and the villagers encounter Godzilla up a hill. Yamane returns to Tokyo to present his findings and concludes that Godzilla was resurrected by repeated nuclear tests. Ships are sent with depth charges to kill the monster. However, Godzilla appears to have survived and causes nationwide panic. Officials appeal to Yamane for ideas to kill the monster, but Yamane wants him kept alive and studied.

Yamanes daughter, Emiko, decides to break off her arranged engagement to Yamanes colleague, Daisuke Serizawa, because of her love for Hideto Ogata, a salvage ship captain. However, Serizawa gives her a demonstration of his recent project which horrifies her and is sworn to secrecy while unable to break off the engagement. That night Godzilla surfaces from Tokyo Bay and attacks the city. The next morning, the JSDF construct a line of tall electrical towers along the coast of Tokyo. Godzilla resurfaces and breaks through the electrical fences, proceeding with his rampage across Tokyo.

Distraught by the devastation, Emiko tells Ogata about Serizawas Oxygen Destroyer, which disintegrates oxygen atoms and the organisms die of a rotting asphyxiation. Emiko and Ogata go to Serizawa to convince him to use the Oxygen Destroyer but he initially refuses. After watching a program displaying the nations current tragedy,  Serizawa finally accepts Emiko and Ogatas pleas.

A navy ship takes Ogata and Serizawa to plant the device in Tokyo Bay. After finding Godzilla, Serizawa unloads the device and cuts off his air support, taking the secrets of the Oxygen Destroyer to his death. The mission proves to be a success but many mourn Serizawas death. Yamane reveals his belief that if nuclear tests continue, another Godzilla may rise in the future.

==Themes==
In the film, Godzilla is represented as a symbol for nuclear holocaust and ever since the films initial release, Godzilla has been culturally identified as a strong metaphor for nuclear weapons.  In the film, Godzillas attack mirrors the same horrors the Japanese experienced near the end of World War II, with the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka stated that, "The theme of the film, from the beginning, was the terror of the bomb. Mankind had created the bomb, and now nature was going to take revenge on mankind." Steve Ryfle, Godzillas Footprint Essay, 2006  Director Ishirō Honda filmed Godzillas rampage on Tokyo with the mentality that the monsters onslaught was a parallel to, and a physical manifestation of, an Atom bomb attack. He stated, "If Godzilla had been a dinosaur or some other animal, he would have been killed by just one cannonball. But if he were equal to an atomic bomb, we wouldnt know what to do. So, I took the characteristics of an atomic bomb and applied them to Godzilla." 

==Production==
 

===Development=== Lucky Dragon radiation sickness and at least one died six months later.  This created widespread fear of uncontrolled and unpredictable nuclear weapons, which the film makers symbolized with Godzilla.  The actual event played a major role in drawing attention to the hazards of nuclear fallout, and concerns were widespread about radioactively contaminated fish affecting the Japanese food supply.

Godzillas climactic attack on Tokyo was meant to exemplify a rolling nuclear attack, like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only much more slowly. Honda had plotted it this way, having been shocked by the real devastation of those cities.

===Story===
The film went through several different drafts. Science fiction and horror novelist Shigeru Kayama was hired to write the original story.  The screenplay was written by Takeo Murata and Ishiro Honda.  In Kayamas draft, originally entitled Kaitei ni-man mairu kara kita daikaijû (lit. "The Giant Monster from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"), and then later renamed G-Sakuhun (lit. Project G, with the G standing for the English word for Giant), Dr. Yamane was the antagonist and was seen as a mad scientist wearing a cape who lived in a gothic style house. Godzillas first appearance was to have him rise from the sea at night and destroy a light house. This was an obvious homage to The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Murata and Honda altered and changed a few things from Kayamas draft and added new elements, like the love triangle between Emiko, Ogata, and Dr. Serizawa.  Dr. Yamane was changed from a mad scientist to an acclaimed paleontologist who seeks to study Godzilla rather than destroy him.  Godzilla itself was changed from Kayamas initial wild beast that came ashore to feed on live animals. 

===Design===
 , Iguanodon, and Stegosaurus, to shape Godzillas final and iconic design.]]
The monster story itself had been necessitated by an emergency.  The producers had planned a completely different film, but that project had fallen apart.  Toho demanded a film, any film, within a short time.  During an airplane ride, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka had read of the Lucky Dragon incident, and was inspired.  The monster angle was derived from the success of Warner Bros. 1953 film The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.  It was then that the creation of the monsters design began to take place, beginning with the films special effects director, Eiji Tsuburayas original suggestion of the monster being a giant octopus, the monster design later went several variations and features such as a hideous disproportionate ape-like creature with head shaped like a mushroom, recalling the suggested references of mushroom clouds. In the end, the filmmakers eventually settled on a dinosaur-like monster that was a cross of a Tyrannosaurus rex, an Iguanodon, a Stegosaurus, and a fire-breathing dragon.
 King Kong. However, that method was far too costly and time-consuming (even though stop-motion would be used briefly, in one scene where Godzilla destroys the Nichigeki Theatre with his tail). It was decided that the easiest way to go was a stuntman in a monster suit, and a scale-model of Tokyo. This also proved difficult. Stunt actor Haruo Nakajima volunteered to play (the full suit) Godzilla. Nakajima would play Godzilla in later sequels until his retirement from the character in 1972. The first attempt at a Godzilla suit was far too stiff and heavy, nearly impossible to use. They finally hit on a design that worked; but even that was grueling. The stuntman would suffer numerous bouts of heat exhaustion and dehydration. The suit had to have a valve to drain the sweat from it. Also, in order to avoid suffocation, the suit could have only been worn for three minutes. It has also been said that, at one point, Nakajima passed out in the suit due to heat exhaustion. Godzillas name was also found difficult to accomplish. The monster went through several names prior to the final stages. Because the monster had no name, the first draft of the film was not called Gojira but rather titled G, also known as Kaihatsu keikaku G ("Development Plan G"), the "G" of the title stood for "Giant", however. Nakajima confirmed that Toho held a contest to name the monster. The monster was eventually named Gojira, a combination of the Japanese words Gorilla (gorira) and Whale (kujira). One explanation that is now known to be false was that a staff member of Toho inspired the name Gojira because that name was claimed to have been his nickname; this was confirmed to be false by the widow of Ishiro Honda, Kimi Honda, in an interview.

===Filming===
Toho Studios had balked at the suggestion of filming Godzilla in color. Ironically, the cheaper black-and-white film had actually enhanced the special effects (e.g. hiding wires and other things in the shadows), and otherwise adding to the overall chill of Godzillas nighttime attacks. Two years later, Toho would film Rodan (film)|Rodan in color, which it would subsequently use in nearly all its giant-monster films.

For a special effects shoot for the movie, Nakajima, who was inside the Godzilla suit, was placed in a swimming pool. Masaaki Tachibana (an announcer of a scene in a steel tower) painted his face with olive oil to express that he was sweating with fear. There were many scenes filmed that were not used, but most have not been recovered. The best known example was the scene that was meant to replace the iconic appearance of Godzilla on Odo Island. Originally, Godzilla arrives holding a dead cow in his mouth, but the effect was not convincing enough and was cut, and only a few stills remain.

==Box office and reception==

===Japan===
When Godzilla was first released in 1954 the film sold approximately 9,610,000 tickets and was the eighth best-attended film in Japan that year.  It remains the second most-attended "Godzilla" film in Japan, behind King Kong vs. Godzilla. Its box office earnings were 152 million Yen ($2.25 million). 

The film initially received mixed to negative reviews in Japan. Japanese critics accused the film of exploiting the widespread devastation that the country had suffered in World War II,    as well as the Daigo Fukuryū Maru (Lucky Dragon) incident that occurred a few months before filming began. Ishiro Honda lamented years later in the Tokyo Journal, "They called it grotesque junk, and said it looked like something youd spit up. I felt sorry for my crew because they had worked so hard!".  However as time went on, the film gained more respect in its home country. In 1984, Kinema Junpo magazine listed Gojira as one of the top 20 Japanese films of all time, while a survey of 370 Japanese movie critics published in Nihon Eiga Besuto 150 (Best 150 Japanese Films), had Godzilla ranked as the 27th best Japanese film ever made. 

The film was nominated for two Japanese Movie Association awards. One for best special effects and the other for best film. It won best special effects  but lost best picture to Akira Kurosawas Seven Samurai  .

===North America===
In 1955 and in the 1960s, the original Gojira played in theaters catering to Japanese-Americans in predominantly Japanese neighborhoods in the United States. An English sub-titled version was shown at film festivals in New York, Chicago and other cities in 1982. 

====Godzilla, King of the Monsters!====
 
In 1956, Jewell Enterprises re-edited, and eliminated many scenes from the film for American audiences. They combined the original Japanese footage of Godzilla with new American-made footage of Raymond Burr as an American reporter covering the monsters activities who would explain the action for an English-speaking audience with minimal dubbing. This version was released in Japan in 1957 in faux widescreen format, where, like the original, it became very popular.

By the end of its run, it grossed $412,520 USD.   The film played in roughly sixty theaters  and cities across the United States during its  -month run.

On April 18, 2014, Rialto re-released the film in another traveling tour style limited release coast to coast across the United States. This was to coincide with not only Godzillas 60th anniversary, but also in celebration of the new Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla movie, which was released in theaters in May. To avoid confusion with the Hollywood film, the re-release was subtitled The Japanese Original.    The film opened with $10,903 playing in one theater in New York City.  The film played in roughly 66 theaters in 64 cities from April 18 to October 31.  After its run, the film had a final gross of $150,191. 

=====Critical reception=====
The 2004 American re-release of Godzilla received acclaim by many critics who had never seen the film in its original form without Raymond Burr. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has received a "certified fresh" rating of 93%, with a consensus saying "More than straight monster-movie fare, Gojira offers potent, sobering postwar commentary". 

In Entertainment Weekly, Owen Glieberman, who gave the film an A- rating, wrote: "Godzilla, an ancient beast roused from the ocean depths and irradiated by Japanese H-bomb tests, reduces Tokyo to a pile of ash, yet, like Kong, he grows more sympathetic as his rampage goes on. The characters talk about him not as an enemy but as a force of destiny, a "god". The inescapable subtext is that Japan, in some bizarre way, deserves this hell. Godzilla is pop cultures grandest symbol of nuclear apocalypse, but he is also the primordial spirit of Japanese aggression turned, with something like fate, against itself."  

In the Dallas Observer, Luke Y. Thompson wrote: "A lot of people are likely to be surprised by what they see. The 1954 Japanese cut is shot like a classic film noir, and the buildup to Tokyos inevitable thrashing is quite slow by todays standards. The echoes of World War II are very strong, and the devastation wrought by Godzilla (played by Haruo Nakajima) is not sugar-coated; it eerily mirrors that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the deaths and injuries are dwelt upon. The monster himself is not fully revealed for quite a while, and even when he finally shows up, hes a malevolent black predator with glistening skin, who stays mostly in the shadows, many times more fearsome than the green-skinned cookie monster who showed up in the various sequels to layeth the smacketh down on the candyasses of numerous alien invaders in ugly leotards."  

One of the few recent mixed reviews was written by Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. Ebert admitted the film was "an important one" and "properly decoded, was the Fahrenheit 9/11 of its time", but he also said: "In these days of flawless special effects, Godzilla and the city he destroys are equally crude. Godzilla at times looks uncannily like a man in a rubber suit, stomping on cardboard sets, as indeed he was, and did. Other scenes show him as a stuffed, awkward animatronic model. This was not state-of-the-art even at the time; King Kong (1933) was much more convincing. When Dr. Serizawa demonstrates the Oxygen Destroyer to his fiancee, Emiko  , the super weapon is somewhat anticlimactic. He drops a pill into a tank of tropical fish, the tank lights up, he shouts, "stand back!" the fiancée screams, and the fish go belly-up. Yeah, thatll stop Godzilla in his tracks."  

Since its release, Godzilla has been regarded not only as one of the best giant monster films ever made but an important cinematic achievement.  The film was ranked #31 in Empire (magazine)|Empire magazines "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" in 2010. {{cite web
