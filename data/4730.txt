==Plot==
 
In  , Maroni threw acid in Harveys face; Batman tried to stop him but failed. After meeting Batman-obsessed psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, Bruce invites her to a charity circus event. There, Two-Face and his henchmen storm the event in an attempt to discover Batmans secret identity, and in the process murder The Flying Graysons, a family of acrobats who attempt to stop him. The youngest member, Dick Grayson|Dick, survives and throws Two-Faces bomb into the river to detonate safely underwater but the rest of the family dies.

Bruce assumes responsibility for Dick and allows him to stay at Wayne Manor. Dick then declares his intention to kill Two-Face and avenge his familys murder, and when he discovers Bruces secret identity as Batman, he insists on becoming his partner, "Robin (comics)|Robin". Meanwhile, Nygma becomes a criminal known as the "Riddler", the master of puzzles and quizzes and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two work together to steal capital for the mass production and promotion of Nygmas television device. Using his device, Nygma can read and control peoples minds, and steal their intelligence quotient. At a business party, Nygma discovers Bruces secret identity. Two-Face then attacks the party and almost succeeds in killing Batman, but Robin arrives just in time to save his life. Meanwhile, Chase realizes her love for Bruce surpasses her obsession with Batman, but soon discovers that they are one and the same. However, Two-Face and the Riddler later assault Wayne Manor. The Riddler enters the Batcave and destroys most of the equipment, while Two-Face kidnaps Chase; Bruce, meanwhile, is left another riddle.
 Batman and Robin locate Two-Face and the Riddlers lair, Claw Island, where both are separated upon reaching the island. Robin then encounters Two-Face and manages to beat him to the ground; realizing that he does not have it in him to commit murder, Robin helps the villain back up. Two-Face pulls out a pistol and captures Robin. Meanwhile, Batman manages to make his way into the Riddlers lair, where Robin and Chase are revealed as hostages, bound, gagged with duct tape and held over a watery chasm, giving Batman a choice of saving just one hostage. Batman finds a way to save both hostages, and manages to destroy the brainwave-collecting device. The devices malfunction drives the Riddler into a mental breakdown in the process. During the battle, while Two-Face tosses his coin to decide Batmans fate, Batman throws a handful of coins towards him, which causes him to lose his balance and fall to his death while searching for his coin. The Riddler is sent to Arkham Asylum, and Chase is asked to consult on his case. Nygma offers to reveal the identity of Batman to her, but he believes that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase then meets Bruce Wayne outside and tells him his secret is safe. Batman and Robin then continue to protect Gotham City from crime.

==Production==

===Development=== The Client - to write the second draft of the script. 

Production went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Dr. Chase Meridian but Michael Keaton decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the new direction the film series was heading in.    Keaton also wanted to pursue "more interesting roles",  turning down $15 million to appear in Batman Forever.  Val Kilmer was cast days later, and the filmmakers decided that Russo was too old for Kilmer, replacing her with a different actress.  Schumacher became interested in Kilmer for Batman after seeing him in Tombstone (film)|Tombstone, and the actor accepted the role without even reading the script or knowing who the new director was.    Before Val Kilmer was cast, Daniel Day-Lewis, Ralph Fiennes, William Baldwin and Johnny Depp were all under consideration to replace Michael Keaton.   Ethan Hawke turned down the role over fear of typecasting, but later regretted the decision. 
 Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted due to too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for Batman Forever. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor.  Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher.  Chris ODonnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double.   

===Filming===
Filming started in September 1994.  Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a "force" and felt Ling could "advance on it". Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be in any way connected to the previous films, and instead was to be inspired by the images from the Batman comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a "city with personality", with more statues, as well as various amounts of neon.

Schumacher had problems filming with Kilmer, whom he described as "childish and impossible", reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher during two weeks after the director told him to stop behaving in a rude way.    Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: "Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. Im tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I dont work with them again."  Carrey later acknowledged Jones was not friendly to him, telling him once off-set during the production, "I hate you. I really dont like you ... I cannot sanction your buffoonery."    

===Design and effects===
 Rick Baker designed the prosthetic makeup. John Dykstra, Andrew Adamson and Jim Rygiel served as visual effects supervisors, with Pacific Data Images also contributing to visual effects work. PDI provided a computer-generated Batman for complicated stunts.  For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batmans costume was redesigned along the lines of a more "MTV organic, and edgier feel" to the suit.    Sound editing and mixing was co-supervised by Bruce Stambler and John Levesque, which included trips to caves to record bat sounds.    A new Batmobile was designed for Batman Forever, with two cars being constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close-ups with both showcasing a V8 engine.    Swiss surrealist painter H.R. Giger provided his version for the Batmobile but it was considered too sinister for the film.

===Music===
 
Elliot Goldenthal was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written, whereas most composers are hired during production. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from Danny Elfman, and requested an original composition.  The films promotional teaser trailer used the main title theme from Elfmans score of 1989s Batman 1989|Batman. 
 soundtrack to Brandy (both songs also included in the film), Method Man, Nick Cave, Michael Hutchence (of INXS), PJ Harvey, and Massive Attack, was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scotts words) make the film more "pop".

==Deleted scenes==
Batman Forever went through a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the movies original length was closer to two hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the films 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given special edition DVD releases on the same day as the Batman Begins DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features. 

Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film, others scenes had footage removed. These included:

* The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois had another scene filmed here in the role of Doctor Burton, but his role was reduced in the final film. He discovers Two-Faces escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Faces cell with "The Bat Must Die" written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the films opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience.
* When Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line "If the Bat wants to play, well play!".
* There was a sequence that contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they both struggle for control of the helicopter. In this scene, Two-Face accuses Batman of being "a killer too", a direct continuity reference to the first two Batman films in which Batman killed the Joker, the Penguin and several of their respective goons. Two-face then manages to escape by the parachute, after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the  special edition DVD. 
* A scene right before Edward Nygma arrived at Wayne Manor. It featured Bruce Wayne watching a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.
* One scene right before Riddler and Two-face team up featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial art training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.
* The scene where the Riddler fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten, presumably to death.
* One sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobiles tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.
* The construction of NygmaTech was after Batman solves the third riddle and was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Edward Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island.
* Sugar and Spice, played by Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, try out the Riddlers device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic adaptation but not in the final film.
* There was originally a scene after the montage of Alfred and Bruce examining the NygmaTech "Box".
* An extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman himself being "a killer", and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from Batman Returns, specifically taken from the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman. This would explain why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems and else in the Batcave telling Dick hes gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the Special Edition DVD. 
* Another scene in the Wayne Manor raid sequence was longer, featuring Bruce and Chase fighting Two-Face and his thugs.
* The scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door. Rick Baker, who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.
* The fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.
* The original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in Batman Returns) facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him "Does it ever end, Alfred?. "Alfred replies, "No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime..." The Bat-Signal shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special edition DVD, but not in its entirety. The sequence with Batman and Robin at the end of this scene is not to be confused with a commercial for the video game, whose appears in a teaser trailer for the video game, which is on the VHS release of this film, released in the UK on December 3, 1995.

==Release==

===Box office===
Batman Forever opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.78 million in its opening weekend.    This was the highest opening weekend of all time up to that point.    The film went on to gross $184.03 million in North America, and $152.5 million in international countries, totaling $336.53 million. Batman Forever was declared a huge financial success.  The film earned more money than its predecessor Batman Returns,  and was the second-highest (behind Toy Story) grossing film of 1995, in the U.S. 

===Critical reaction  ===
Based on 58 reviews collected by the review aggregator website   collected an average score of 51, based on 23 reviews. 
 Gotham cityscapes appear too obviously fake. Elliot Goldenthals score, while serviceable, also isnt as stirring as Danny Elfmans work in the first two films." 

  for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating was a joke."  Mick LaSalle had a mixed reaction, concluding "a shot of Kilmers rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience." 
 SFX by inserting an assertion that Batman Forever was "the worst" (Batman movie) in response to the adverts own suggestive question, pithily pre-empting that magazines own coverage. 

===Accolades=== Cinematography (lost Sound (Donald Apollo 13) Sound Editing Best Fantasy Special Effects Costume Design Grammy Award Best Villain; Best Song from a Movie). However, it won in just one category — Best Song from a Movie for Seals "Kiss from a Rose".

===Merchandising=== Alan Grant wrote separate novelizations of the film.   Dennis ONeil authored a comic book adaptation, with art by Michal Dutkiewicz. 

Six Flags Great Adventure theme park re-themed their "Axis Chemical" arena, home of the Batman stunt show, to resemble "Batman Forever", and the new show featured props from the film. Because of the mostly negative critical reaction however, the stunt arena was changed back to its original version after the season. Six Flags Over Texas featured a one-time firework show to promote the movie, and replica busts of Batman, Robin, Two-Face, and the Riddler can still be found in the Justice League store in the Looney Tunes U.S.A. section.
