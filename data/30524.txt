}}  The Year overthrow of President Sukarno. It follows a group of foreign correspondents in Jakarta on the eve of an attempted coup by the 30 September Movement in 1965.

The film stars Mel Gibson as Guy Hamilton, an Australian journalist, and Sigourney Weaver as Jill Bryant, a British Embassy officer. It also stars  Linda Hunt as the male dwarf Billy Kwan, Hamiltons local photographer contact, a role for which Hunt won the 1983 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

 Italian phrase vivere pericolosamente, meaning "living dangerously". Sukarno borrowed the line for the title of his Indonesian Independence Day speech of 1964.

==Plot==
Guy Hamilton, a neophyte foreign correspondent for an Australian network, arrives in Jakarta on assignment. He meets the close-knit members of the foreign correspondent community including journalists from the UK, the US and New Zealand, diplomatic personnel, and a Chinese-Australian dwarf of high intelligence and moral seriousness, Billy Kwan. Hamilton is initially unsuccessful because his predecessor, tired of life in Indonesia, had departed without introducing Hamilton to his contacts. He receives limited sympathy from the journalist community, which competes for scraps of information from Sukarnos government, the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and the conservative Muslim military. However, Kwan takes a liking to Hamilton and arranges interviews for him with key political figures.
 Communist Chinese are arming the PKI, Bryant passes this information to Hamilton to save his life, but he wants to cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Shocked, Kwan and Bryant withdraw their friendship from Hamilton, and he is left with the American journalist Pete Curtis, and his own assistant and driver Kumar, who is secretly PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Hamilton and tries to open his eyes to all that is going on.

Kwan, outraged by Sukarnos failure to meet the needs of most Indonesians, decides to hang a sign saying "Sukarno feed your people" from the Hotel Indonesia expressing his outrage but is thrown from the window by security men, and dies in Hamiltons arms. His death is also witnessed by Jill. Still in search of "the big story", Hamilton visits the Presidential palace after the army generals have taken over and unleashed executions, after they learned of the Communist shipment. Struck down by an Army officer, Hamilton suffers a detached retina.

Resting alone in Kwans bungalow, Hamilton recalls a passage from the Bhagavad Gita ("all is clouded by desire") which Billy told him. Kumar visits him and tells him about the failed coup attempt. Risking permanent damage to his eye, a heavily bandaged Hamilton implores Kumar to drive him to the airport, where he boards the last plane out of Jakarta and is reunited with Bryant.

==Historical accuracy==
 
In the film, the PKI is portrayed as being solely responsible for the 1965 coup attempt—following the official Suharto government version, as opposed to other theories.

==Production==
A number of filmmakers were interested in buying the rights to Christopher Kochs novel including Phillip Noyce. It was Peter Weir who was successful. Christopher Koch wrote an early draft but Weir was unhappy with it. Alan Sharp wrote three more drafts, then David Williamson was brought on to do several more drafts. Koch later came back on to work on some of the voice over, although he never spoke with Peter Weir. Koch later claimed that the final script was "55% Williamson/Weir, and 45% Koch". Christopher Koch, "Screenplay by...", Cinema Papers, March 1983 p10 

The film was originally backed by the South Australian Film Corporation and the Australian Film Commission, with international distribution arranged by MGM-UA. However, the SAFC then dropped out and Weirs agent suggested MGM provide the entire $6 million budget themselves, which is what happened.    It was by far the most ambitious Australian film undertaken at the time and was one of the first co-productions between Australia and a Hollywood studio. 

 
Dancer David Atkins was originally cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir began to feel that the relationship between his character and Mel Gibsons was not working so he decided to recast. Several actors auditioned, including Bob Balaban and Wallace Shawn, when Weir saw a photo of Linda Hunt. He asked for her to audition and decided to cast her.  To accomplish the role during production, Hunt shortened "her hair and dye  it black  wore padding around her waist, shaved her eyebrows, and carried something in her shirt pocket."  In her 1986 interview with Bomb (magazine)|Bomb magazine, Hunt remarked that Billy Kwan "is supra-personal   layers of sexual ambiguity " 

Although originally set to be filmed in Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so the bulk of the movie was filmed in the Philippines.  Death threats against Peter Weir and Mel Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia.  Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, "It wasnt really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing is really going to happen. I mean, if they meant to kill us, why send a note?"  

Mel Gibson described his character Guy, saying, “Hes not a silver-tongued devil. Hes kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me.” 

"LEnfant", a track from Vangelis 1979 album Opera sauvage, was featured in the film.

==Reception==
The Year of Living Dangerously was entered into the 1983 Cannes Film Festival    where it was well received by audiences and critics.   
 The Road Warrior), then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence".    However, Time (magazine)|Time magazines Richard Corliss wrote, "But in his attempt to blend his preoccupations with the plot of C. J. Kochs 1978 novel, Weir has perhaps packed too much imagery and information into his movie ... The plot becomes landlocked in true-life implausibilities; the characters rarely get a hold on the moviegoers heart or lapels".    In his review for the Washington Post, Gary Arnold described the film as "a grievously flawed yet compelling tale of political intrigue, certainly a triumph of atmosphere if not of coherent dramatization".    Newsweek magazine called the film "an annoying failure because it fritters away so many rich opportunities".   

===Box office===
Filmed on an estimated budget of $13,000,000, The Year of Living Dangerously grossed $2,898,000 at the box office in Australia,  and $10,278,575 in the U.S.
