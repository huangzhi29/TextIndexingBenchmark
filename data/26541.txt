Repo Man received near-universal acclaim and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1984.         

==Plot==

The film opens outside of Goffs, California, in the Mojave Desert. A 1964 Chevrolet Malibu driven by Dr. J. Frank Parnell (Fox Harris) is pulled over by a policeman. The cop opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind.
 Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) drives up and offers him $15, then $25, to drive a car out of the neighborhood.

Otto follows Bud in the car to the "Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation" (a small automobile repossession agency), where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a repossession agent, or "repo man", and goes to his parents house.  He learns that his Burnout (psychology)|burned-out, Cannabis (drug)|pot-smoking, ex-hippie parents (Jonathan Hugger, Sharon Gregg) have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked Televangelism|televangelist.  He decides to take the job since it pays cash.

Otto soon learns that, as Bud had told him, "the life of a repo man is always intense." He enjoys the fast living, drug use, car chases, hot-wiring cars, and good pay. His old life is boring by comparison.

After repossessing a flashy red sedan, Otto sees a girl named Leila (Olivia Barash) running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet, where they have sex in the backseat. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dead but still dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand and its repo rivals are offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual worth of the car.

Parnell finally arrives in L.A., but he is unable to meet up with his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When he pulls into a gas station, the Rodriguez brothers nab the car. They stop for sodas because the cars trunk is so hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Ottos punk friends, who are on a crime spree (what they call "doing crimes"), steal the Malibu.

After they visit a night club, Parnell tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing one of them and scaring the other two away, allowing him to take the car back. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly, talking about how a brilliant scientist friend gave himself a lobotomy to deal with his work, then reveals his friend drives a Chevy Malibu before collapsing and dying from radiation exposure. Otto takes the car back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen from the lot, and a chase ensues with all the characters involved. By this time, the car is glowing bright green because it is so irradiated. Eventually, the car makes its way back to the Helping Hand lot, where various groups are trying to acquire the car - government agents, the UFO scientists, and even the televangelist Ottos parents gave his college funds to. However, anyone who approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits.. Only the simpleton Miller, who works at Helping Hand, is able to approach and enter the car.  He slides behind the wheel, apparently impervious to the radiation. He beckons Otto into the Malibu, and Otto accepts eagerly, dismissing Leilas confession of love (at which she says shes glad she sold him out to the government). After he settles into the passenger seat, the Malibu lifts straight up into the air. The film closes with the car zooming through the air around downtown LA and then off into the stars.
