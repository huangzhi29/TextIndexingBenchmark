La Jetée ( ) ("The Jetty," here referring to an outdoor viewing pier at an airport), is a 1962 French science fiction featurette by Chris Marker. Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the story of a post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear war experiment in time travel. It is 28 mins long, black and white. It won the Prix Jean Vigo for short film.

The 1995 science fiction film 12 Monkeys was inspired by, and borrows several concepts directly from, La Jetée.

==Plot== Palais de Chaillot galleries. Scientists research time travel, hoping to send test subjects to different time periods "to call past and future to the rescue of the present". They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the prisoner; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory from his pre-war childhood of a woman (Hélène Chatelain) he had seen on the observation platform ("the jetty") at Orly Airport shortly before witnessing a startling incident there.  He had not understood exactly what happened but knew he had seen a man die.

After several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.

Upon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently; but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned and does find her, on the jetty at the airport. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him ever since, was his own death.

==Cast==
* Jean Négroni as narrator
* Hélène Chatelain as the Woman
* Davos Hanich as the Man
* Jacques Ledoux as The Experimenter
* Ligia Branice as a woman from the future
* Janine Kleina as a woman from the future William Klein as a man from the future

==Production== optically printed photographs playing out as a photomontage of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a Pentax Spotmatic  and the motion-picture segment was shot with a 35mm Arriflex.  The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a voice-over narrator.  The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to Alfred Hitchcocks 1958 film Vertigo (film)|Vertigo which Marker also references in his 1983 film Sans soleil. 

==Influence and legacy== 12 Monkeys Panda Bear has lyrics inspired by the themes of the film.

  ranked La Jetée first in its list of "Top 10 time-travel movies".    Poll, the British Film Institute deemed La Jetée as the 50th greatest film of all time.   

==Home media release== Arte Video. In Region 1, the Criterion Collection has released a La Jetée/Sans soleil combination DVD / Blu-ray, which features the option of hearing the English or French narration.
