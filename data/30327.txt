}} science fiction the Terminator, Sarah Connor, played by Hamilton, whose son will one day become a savior against machines. Biehn plays Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future sent back in time to protect Sarah.

Though not expected to be either a commercial or critical success, The Terminator topped the American box office for two weeks and helped launch the film career of Cameron and consolidate that of Schwarzenegger. The Terminator was followed up with a sequel in   in 1991 which was also directed by Cameron. In 2008, The Terminator was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the American National Film Registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
==Plot==
 
 Sarah Connor; the other is Kyle Reese, a human resistance fighter sent to protect her from the T-800. After the Terminator kills a gang member, a gun-shop manager, and two other women named "Sarah Connor" listed in the telephone directory, Sarahs roommate Ginger, and her partner, it eventually tracks its target to a nightclub. Kyle shows up and saves Sarah from the Terminators attack, and the two escape, and the Terminator steals a police car.
 Skynet will John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet has sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, as a last-ditch effort to avert the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton, but with an external layer of living tissue that makes it resemble a human being.

Kyle and Sarah are again attacked by the Terminator, leading to a car chase. Their cars eventually crash into a wall. Kyle and Sarah are caught by the police, but the Terminator flees the scene. Kyle is questioned by criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman who concludes that he is paranoid and delusional. Sarah is also questioned by Lieutenant Traxler and Sergeant Vukovich about the events that happened. The Terminator goes to a run-down inn, where it performs treatment on itself and sees how its inner workings function. Soon after, the Terminator (now wearing sunglasses to hide its red mechanical eye) attacks the police station, killing many police officers, including Traxler and Vukovich, in its attempt to locate Sarah; however, Sarah and Kyle manage to escape and spend the night under a bridge before seeking refuge in a motel, where they also assemble some pipe bombs. Sarah understands that the Terminator is sure to find them again, and theyre not safe from it, no matter where they go. Kyle confesses that he has long been in love with Sarah; John had inexplicably given him a photograph of her shortly after he met John. Sarah reciprocates Kyles feelings and they have sex.

Later that night, the Terminator tracks them to the motel and Kyle and Sarah escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle throws pipe bombs at the Terminator in an effort to destroy it. Kyle is wounded by the Terminators gunfire. Sarah manages to knock the Terminator off its motorbike but loses control of the pickup truck, which flips over. As the Terminator gets up, it is struck by a gasoline tanker truck that drags it a short distance. When the truck driver gets out of the truck to see what happened, the Terminator kills him, hijacks the truck, and resumes the chase. Kyle slides a pipe bomb on to the trucks fuel trailer causing a massive explosion, before which Kyle takes cover in a dumpster. The Terminator emerges from the burning truck covered with flames and collapses, seemingly destroyed.

The Terminator, with its clothes and flesh covering burned away, suddenly rises up and continues to pursue them into a factory. Kyle activates the factorys machinery to try and confuse the Terminator and attacks it with a metal pipe but it knocks him down. Though dazed, he jams his final pipe bomb into its abdomen, causing an explosion which apparently destroys it; the explosion kills Kyle and injures Sarah. Now a one-armed, legless torso, the Terminator resumes its attempt to kill Sarah. She leads it through the factory into a hydraulic press which she activates, crushing and finally deactivating it. Sarah is later taken out of the factory by an ambulance as Kyles body is taken away. The authorities are also seen analyzing some of the components of the Terminator.

===Development===
  The Outer The Road Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling.   Cameron gave Wisher the early scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department scenes to write.  As Wisher lived far away from Cameron, the two communicated script ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone. 

Camerons agent hated the idea for The Terminator and told him to work on something else. After this, Cameron fired his agent. Keegan, 2009. p. 36  The initial outline of the script involved two Terminators sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was a liquid metal cyborg that could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry. Keegan, 2009. p. 110  Cameron could not think of a good way to depict this robot, stating that he "was seeing things in his head that couldnt be done with existing technology."  Keegan, 2009. p. 111  The story of the cyborgs in the film was cut down to a single robot idea.  The liquid metal Terminator would be revisited with the  . 

  Hemdale Pictures. Keegan, 2009. p. 38 

Cameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.  Henriksen showed up at the office kicking open the door wearing a leather jacket and had gold foil smothered on his teeth and fake cuts on his face and then sat in a chair.  Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksens act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Camerons sketches and passion for the film.  In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion.  Keegan, 2009. p. 39  The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million.

{{Quote box |quote="Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator, on the other hand, shouldnt have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and theres no way you wouldnt spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they dont have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If theres a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they dont care if it goes against whats likely."

One of Camerons first tasks was to find someone to play Kyle Reese. Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orions co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator.  Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. The studio had suggested O. J. Simpson for the role of the Terminator, but Cameron did not feel that Simpson would be believable as a killer.   Cameron still agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him. Cameron planned to pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role.   
 Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, "Oh some shit movie Im doing, take a couple weeks." Andrews, 2003. pp. 120–121  He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan The Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough so that it wouldnt be a risk to his career if it were unsuccessful, also admitting that "it took   awhile to figure out that Jim   was the real deal" (i.e. a director as talented as Spielberg, Hitchcock or Coppola). In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.  Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and less than 100 words. James Cameron said that "Somehow, even his   accent worked...It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadnt gotten the voice thing quite worked out." 

For the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting (musician)|Sting.  Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his "feelings about the project changed". Keegan, 2009. p. 42  Hurd stated that "almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between  . They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off." Keegan, 2009. p. 43 
 Children of Dick Smith who had previously worked on The Godfather and Taxi Driver. Smith did not take Camerons offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston for the job. Keegan, 2009. p. 50

There was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine cyborg for Reese, which Cameron turned down, and the second was to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. French, 1996. p. 23  On creating the Terminators look, Winston and Cameron passed their sketches back and forth. They eventually decided on a design that was nearly identical to the original one Cameron drew in Rome.  Keegan, 2009. p. 51  Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a puppet of the Terminator. It was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzeneggers face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster. 

Both the sequences in 2029 and stop motion scenes in the film were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Junior. French, 1996. p. 24  A stop motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away. This limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger. French, 1996. p. 25  French, 1996. p. 26 

One of the guns seen in the film and on the films poster was an AMT Hardballer Longslide modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available, because of the high power requirement, the helium-neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Arnold Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.   

In March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.     Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that "...the movie took on a larger than life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didnt think I would do&nbsp;– scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldnt be, because now they were too flamboyant." French, 1996. p. 30  French, 1996. p. 31  Most of The Terminator s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamiltons ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain. Keegan, 2009. p. 52 

Schwarzenegger tried to have the iconic "Ill be back" line changed because of language barriers. In an October 1, 2012 interview on Good Morning America, he revealed that he had difficulty pronouncing the word Ill properly. The actor also felt that his robotic character wouldnt speak in contractions and felt that the Terminator would be more declarative. Schwarzenegger asked James Cameron if he could change the line to: "I will be back", but Cameron refused. As a result, Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous subsequent films throughout his career. 

===Post-production===
 
After production finished on The Terminator, some post-production shots were needed.    These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connors apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminators head being crushed in a press.      The films soundtrack was synthesizer music composed by   was released in 1984. 

==Release==
  two months before The Terminator  premiere in 1984.]]
Orion Pictures did not have faith in The Terminator performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception. Keegan, 2009. p.53  At an early screening of the film, the actors agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics.  Orion only held one press screening for the film.  The film was premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.     Cameron noted that The Terminator was a hit "relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But its better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around." 
 The Outer Limits he had written, titled "Soldier (The Outer Limits)|Soldier", and threatened to sue for infringement.       Orion settled in 1986 and gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and an acknowledgment credit in later prints of the film.  Some accounts of the settlement state that "Demon with a Glass Hand", another Outer Limits episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, Heard, 1997. p.77   French, 1996. p. 16    but Ellison has explicitly stated that The Terminator "was a ripoff" of "Soldier" rather than "Demon with a Glass Hand". 

Cameron was against Orions decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Keegan, 2009. p. 54  Cameron replied that he "had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldnt tell this story, but now I frankly dont care. Its the truth. Harlan Ellison is a parasite who can kiss my ass." Keegan, 2009. p.54  Keegan, 2009. p. 55 

===Marketing===
 
Around and shortly after the films theatrical release, a number of merchandise items and media were released and sold to coincide with the film. Shaun Hutson wrote a novelization of the film which was published on February 21, 1985.  In September 1988, NOW Comics released a comic based on the film. Dark Horse Comics published a comic in 1990 that took place 39 years after the film. Overstreet, 2010. p.252  Several video games based on The Terminator were released between 1991 and 1993 for various Nintendo and Sega systems.    A soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and rock songs used in the club scenes.

The Terminator was released on VHS and Betamax in 1985.  The film performed well financially on its initial release. The Terminator premiered at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video cassette sales charts. In its second week, The Terminator reached number 4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette sales charts.  
In March 1995, The Terminator was released as a letter boxed edition on Laserdisc.  The film premiered through Image Entertainment on DVD, on September 3, 1997.   IGN referred to this DVD as "pretty bare-bones...released with just a mono soundtrack and a kind of poor transfer."   
 MGM released Sony in the United States.  In late 2012, the film was re-released on Blu-ray, this time with a transfer by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which features improved sharpness compared to Sonys 2006 Blu-ray, and revised color grading, as well as expanded extra material, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature. 

==Reception and legacy==
The Terminator has received critical acclaim and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1984. Positive reviews of The Terminator focused on the action scenes and rapid pacing. Variety (magazine)|Variety praised the film, calling it a "blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story...Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog."  Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|Time magazine said that the film has "Plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied." 
Time placed The Terminator on its "10 Best" list for 1984. Keegan, 2009. p.53 
 Milwaukee Journal gave the film 3 stars, calling it "the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien (film)|Alien."  A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that "the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension. Right from the start its all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story...Its like a streamlined Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry movie&nbsp;– no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns."  In the May 1985 issue of Cinefantastique it  was referred to as a film that "manages to be both derivative and original at the same time...not since the Road Warrior has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage" and "an example of science fiction/horror at its best...Camerons no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity". French, 1996. p. 62  In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the films script, special effects, design and Schwarzeneggers performance.  French, 1996. p. 63 
 Newhouse News Service called the film a "lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap".  Best Science best make-up best writing. 

In 1991, Richard Schickel of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film giving it an "A" rating, writing that "what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film" and called it "one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made." 
Film4 gave the film five stars, calling it the "sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining."  TV Guide gave the film four stars referring to it as an "amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget...For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel."  Empire (magazine)|Empire gave the film five stars calling it "As chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets."  The film database Allmovie gave the film five stars, saying that it "established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s." 
 100 Years... 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains.  Arnolds catch phrase "Ill be back" was voted the AFIs 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.  In 2005, Total Film named The Terminator the 72nd-best film ever made.  In 2008, Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine selected The Terminator as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.  Empire also placed the Terminator (character concept)|T-800 14th on their list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters.  In 2008, The Terminator was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.   

==Themes==
Darian Leader considers The Terminator as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the problem of masculinity, stating that it illustrates that to be a man requires more than having the body of a man, and that something symbolic that is not ultimately human must be added. He sees The Terminator as similar to The Six Million Dollar Man and RoboCop in this respect.   

The film also explores the potential dangers of AI, AI Dominance, and AI rebellion.  The robots become self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed.   The impact of this theme is so important that "the prevalent visual representation of AI risk has become the terminator robot."

===Music===
The music of the first six tracks of the album is a synthesizer based film score by Brad Fiedel. "The Terminator Theme" has been described as having a "deceptively simple melody" line and "haunting synthesizer music".    It is in a time signature of  , which came about as Fiedel experimented with the rhythm track on his music equipment; it was initially an accident, but Fiedel found that he liked the "herky-jerky" "propulsiveness."   The track "Love Scene" is a softer piano-based version of the main theme that was described as "bittersweet". "Factory Chase" features an electric violin played by Ross Levinson. 
 Tahnee Cain. Jay Fergusons hit songs. "Intimacy" has been described as "latter-day new wave and primitive, early techno".
