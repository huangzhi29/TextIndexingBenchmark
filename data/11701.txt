 training and the experiences of two of the platoons Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The films title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by infantry riflemen. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 1987.
 Best Adapted Screenplay for Kubrick, Michael Herr|Herr, and Gustav Hasford|Hasford.  In 2001, the American Film Institute placed Full Metal Jacket at No. 95 in their "AFIs 100 Years...100 Thrills" poll. 

==Plot== Parris Island Senior Drill Instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Hartman employs aggressive tactics to turn the recruits into hardened Marines prepared for combat. Among the recruits are Privates "Joker", "Cowboy", and the overweight, bumbling Leonard Lawrence, who earns the nickname "Gomer Pyle" after attracting Hartmans wrath.

Unresponsive to Hartmans discipline, Pyle is eventually paired with Joker. Pyle improves with Jokers help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyles foot locker. Believing the recruits have failed to improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a   Pyle with a blanket party, restraining him in his bunk and beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels. After this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model Marine. This impresses Hartman but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as his talking to his M14 rifle.

Following their graduation the recruits receive their Military Occupational Specialty assignments; Joker is assigned to Basic Military Journalism, while most of the others (including Cowboy and Pyle) are assigned to Infantry. During the platoons final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers a mentally insane Pyle in the bathroom loading his rifle with ammunition. Joker attempts to calm Pyle, who executes drill commands and recites the Riflemans Creed. The noise awakens the platoon and Hartman. Hartman confronts Pyle and orders him to surrender the rifle. Pyle shoots Hartman dead, and then commits suicide.
 Stars and North Vietnamese Army attempts to overrun the base.
 Phu Bai, accompanied by Rafterman. They meet the Lusthog Squad, where Cowboy is now a Sergeant. Joker accompanies the squad during the Battle of Huế, where platoon commander "Touchdown" is killed by the enemy. After the Marines declare the area secure, a team of American news journalists and reporters enters Huế and interviews various Marines about their experiences in Vietnam and their opinions about the war.

During patrol, Crazy Earl, the squad leader, is killed by a booby trap, leaving Cowboy in command. The squad becomes lost and Cowboy orders Eightball to scout the area. A Viet Cong sniper wounds Eightball and the squad medic, Doc Jay, is also wounded while attempting to save him, against orders. Cowboy learns that tank support is unavailable and orders the team to prepare for withdrawal. The squads machine gunner, Animal Mother, disobeys Cowboy and attempts to save his teammates. He discovers there is only one sniper, but Doc Jay and Eightball are killed when Doc Jay attempts to indicate the snipers location. While maneuvering towards the sniper, Cowboy is shot and killed.

Animal Mother assumes command of the squad and leads an attack on the sniper. Joker discovers the sniper, a teenage girl, and attempts to shoot her, but his rifle jams and alerts her to his presence. Rafterman shoots the sniper, mortally wounding her. As the squad converges, the sniper begs for death, prompting an argument about whether or not to kill her. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker shoots her. The Marines congratulate him on his kill as Joker stares into the distance, displaying the thousand-yard stare. The Marines march toward their camp, singing the "Mickey Mouse March". Joker states that despite being "in a world of shit", he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.

==Production==

===Development===
Kubrick contacted Michael Herr, author of the critically acclaimed Vietnam War memoir Dispatches (book)|Dispatches (1977), in the spring of 1980 to discuss working on a film about The Holocaust, but eventually discarded that in favor of a film about the Vietnam War.    They met in England, and the director told him that he wanted to do a war film but had yet to find a story to adapt.    Kubrick discovered Gustav Hasfords novel The Short-Timers (1979) while reading the Virginia Kirkus Review,    and Herr received it in bound galleys, and thought that it was a masterpiece.  In 1982, Kubrick read the novel twice, afterwards thought it "was a unique, absolutely wonderful book", and decided, along with Herr,  to make it the basis for Kubricks next film.  According to the filmmaker, he was drawn to the books dialogue that was "almost poetic in its carved-out, stark quality".  In 1983, he began researching this film, watching past footage and documentaries, reading Vietnamese newspapers on microfilm from the Library of Congress, and studying hundreds of photographs from the era.  Initially, Herr was uninterested in revisiting his Vietnam War experiences, and Kubrick spent three years persuading him in what the author describes as "a single phone call lasting three years, with interruptions". 

In 1985, Kubrick contacted Hasford to work on the screenplay with him and Herr,  often talking to Hasford on the phone three to four times a week for hours at a time. the phrase while going through a gun catalogue.  After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned in his orders, and Hasford and Herr mailed in their submissions.  Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team would repeat the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much they had contributed to the screenplay, which led to a dispute over the final credits.  Hasford remembers, "We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. I was putting on one widget and Michael was putting on another widget and Stanley was the only one who knew that this was going to end up being a car."  Herr says the director was uninterested in making an anti-war film, but "he wanted to show what war is like". 

At some point, Kubrick wanted to meet Hasford in person, but Herr advised against this, describing The Short-Timers author as a "scary man".  Nonetheless, Kubrick insisted, and they all met at Kubricks house in England for dinner. It did not go well, and Hasford was subsequently shut out of the production. 

===Adaptation of novel to film===
 
Film scholar Greg Jenkins has done a detailed analysis of the transition of the story from book to film. The novel is in three parts, while the film largely discards Part III and massively expands the books relatively brief first part about the boot camp on Parris Island. This gives the film a duplex structure, telling two largely separate stories connected by the same characters, one which Jenkins believes is consistent with statements Kubrick made back in the 1960s about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure. 
 Section 8". In contrast, Hartman congratulates Pyle that he is "born again hard". Jenkins believes for Hartman to have been in any way social with the troops would have upset the balance of the film, which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with Hartman as a force of nature embodying a killer culture. 

Various episodes from the book have been cut or conflated with others in the film.  For example, sequences such as Cowboys introduction of the "Lusthog Squad" have both been drastically shortened and supplemented by material from other sections of the book. Although the books final, third section was largely dropped, pieces of material from it were inserted into other episodes of the film;  For instance, the climactic episode with the sniper is a conflation of two episodes in the book, one from part two, and another from part three.  Jenkins sees the films handling of this episode as both more dramatic yet less gruesome than its counterpart in the novel.

The film often has a more tragic tone than the book, which often falls back on callous humor. Joker in the film remains a model of humane thinking, as evidenced by his moral struggle in the sniper episode and elsewhere. His struggle in the film is to overcome his own meekness, rather than to compete with other Marines. Hence, the film omits his eventual domination over Animal Mother. 

The film omits the death of the character Rafterman. Jenkins believed this allowed viewers to reflect on his personal growth in the film and speculate on his further growth afterwards. Jenkins also believed it would not fit into the films plot structure. 

===Casting===
Through Warner Bros., Kubrick advertised a national casting search in the United States and Canada. The director used videotape to audition actors and received over 3,000 videotapes. His staff screened all of the tapes and eliminated the unacceptable ones. This left 800 tapes for Kubrick to personally review.  

Former U.S. Marine Drill Instructor Ermey was originally hired as a technical adviser and asked Kubrick if he could audition for the role of Hartman. Kubrick, having seen his portrayal as Drill Instructor Staff sergeant Loyce in The Boys in Company C (1978) told him he was not vicious enough to play the character. In response, Ermey showcased his ability to play the character, as well as demonstrated just how a Drill Instructor breaks down the individuality of new recruits, by improvising insulting dialogue towards a group of Royal Marines who were being considered for the part of background Marines.   Upon viewing the videotape of these sessions, Kubrick gave Ermey the role, realizing he "was a genius for this part",  and incorporated the 250-page transcript of Ermeys rants into the script.   Ermeys experience as a real-life Drill Instructor during the Vietnam era proved invaluable in this area. According to Kubricks estimate, the former drill instructor wrote 50% of his own dialogue, especially the insults. 

While Ermey practiced his lines in a rehearsal room, a production assistant would throw tennis balls and oranges at him. Ermey had to catch the ball and throw it back as quickly as possible, while at the same time saying his lines as fast as he could. Any hesitation, slur, or missed line would necessitate starting over. 20 error-free runs were required. "  was my drill instructor", Ermey said of the production assistant.  

The original plan envisaged Anthony Michael Hall starring as Private Joker, but after eight months of negotiations, a deal between Kubrick and Hall fell through.  Kubrick offered Bruce Willis a role, but Willis had to turn down the opportunity because of the impending start of filming on the first six episodes of Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting. 

Vincent DOnofrio heard of the auditions for the film from Matthew Modine. Using a rented video camera and dressed in army fatigues, he recorded his audition for the part of Private Pyle. Despite Kubricks calling Pyle "the hardest part to cast in the whole movie", Donofrio received a quick response to his submission, informing him the part was his.  

===Filming=== Newham (east British Gas Cliffe marshes, also on the River Thames, with 200 imported Spanish palm trees  and 100,000 plastic tropical plants from Hong Kong. 
 M41 tanks from a Belgian army colonel (a fan), and Westland Wessex helicopters painted Marine green to represent Marine Corps Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw helicopters. Although the Wessex was a licensed derivative of the Sikorsky H-34, the Wessex substituted two gas turbine engines for the H-34s radial (piston) engine. This resulted in a much longer and less rounded nose than that of the Vietnam era H-34. Kubrick also obtained a selection of rifles, M79 grenade launchers, and M60 machine guns from a licensed weapons dealer. 

Modine described the shoot as difficult: the filming location for Vietnam, Beckton Gas Works, was a toxic and environmental nightmare for the entire film crew. Asbestos and hundreds of chemicals poisoned the earth and air. Modine documents details of shooting at Beckton in his book, Full Metal Jacket Diary (2005). During the "Boot Camp" sequence of the film, Modine and the other recruits had to endure the rigors of Marine Corp training, including having Ermey yelling at them for 10 hours a day during the shooting of the Parris Island scenes. To ensure the actors reactions to Ermey were as authentic and genuine as possible, Ermey and the recruits would not rehearse together.   For film continuity, each recruit had to have his head shaved once a week. 

At one point during filming, Ermey had a car accident, broke all of his ribs on one side, and was out for four-and-half months.  Cowboys death scene shows a building in the background that resembles the famous alien monolith in Kubricks   (1968). Kubrick described the resemblance as an "extraordinary accident". 

During filming, Hasford contemplated legal action over the writing credits. Originally, the filmmakers intended for Hasford to receive an "additional dialogue" credit, but he wanted full credit.  The writer took two friends and sneaked onto the set dressed as extras, only to be mistaken by a crew member for Herr. 
 Vivian — who appears uncredited as a news-camera operator at the mass grave — shadowed the filming of Full Metal Jacket and shot 18 hours of behind-the-scenes footage for a potential "making-of" documentary similar to her earlier film documentary on Kubricks The Shining (1980); however, in this case, her work did not come to fruition. Snippets of her work can be seen in the documentary Stanley Kubricks Boxes (2008).

==Themes==
Compared to Kubricks other works, the themes of Full Metal Jacket have received little attention from critics and reviewers. Michael Pursells essay "Full Metal Jacket: The Unravelling of Patriarchy" (1988) was an early, in-depth consideration of its two-part structure and its criticism of masculinity, arguing that the film shows "war and pornography as facets of the same system".  Most reviews have focused on military brainwashing themes in the boot camp training section of the film, while seeing the latter half of the film as more confusing and disjointed in content. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, "its as if they borrowed bits of every war movie to make this eclectic finale."  Roger Ebert explained, "The movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying."  Julian Rice, in his book Kubricks Hope (2008), sees the second part of the film as continuing the psychic journey of Joker in trying to come to grips with human evil. 

Tony Lucia, in his July 5, 1987 review of Full Metal Jacket for the Reading Eagle, looked at the themes of Kubricks career, suggesting "the unifying element may be the ordinary man dwarfed by situations too vast and imposing to handle" and specifically citing the "military mentality" from this film. He also explained the theme further covered "a man testing himself against his own limitations", and ultimately "Full Metal Jacket is the latest chapter in an ongoing movie which is not merely a comment on our time or a time past, but on something that reaches beyond." 

In a provocative essay on Full Metal Jacket, British critic Gilbert Adair wrote: "Kubricks approach to language has always been reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic in nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all the whims, shades and modulations of personal expression".  

Michael Herr wrote of his work on the script for the film: "The substance was single-minded, the old and always serious problem of how you put into a film or a book the living, behaving presence of what Jung called The Shadow, the most accessible of archetypes, and the easiest to experience... War is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you. As they expressed it in Vietnam, "Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for I am the Evil". 

==Music==
In addition to her work preparing a documentary, Vivian Kubrick, under the alias "Abigail Mead", wrote the films score. According to an interview which appeared in the January 1988 issue of Keyboard Magazine, the film was scored mostly with a Fairlight CMI synthesizer (the then-current Series III edition) and a Synclavier. For the period music, Kubrick went through Billboard charts|Billboards list of Top 100 Hits for each year from 1962–1968 and tried many songs, but "sometimes the dynamic range of the music was too great, and we couldnt work in dialogue." 

* Johnnie Wright – "Hello Vietnam"
* The Dixie Cups – "Chapel of Love" Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs – "Wooly Bully" I Like It Like That"
* Nancy Sinatra – "These Boots Are Made for Walkin"
* The Trashmen – "Surfin Bird"
* Goldman Band – "Marines Hymn"
* The Rolling Stones – "Paint It Black" (end credits)

A single, "Full Metal Jacket (I Wanna Be Your Drill Instructor)", credited to Mead and Nigel Goulding, was released to promote the film. It incorporates Ermeys drill cadences from the film. The single reached number two in the UK pop charts.

===Critical reception===
 
Full Metal Jacket  garnered critical acclaim following its release. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews to give the film a score of 94% based on reviews from 70 critics, with an average rating of 8.4 out of&nbsp;10.   Another aggregator Metacritic gave it a score of 78 out of 100, which indicates a "generally favorable" response, based on 18 reviews.  Reviewers generally reacted favorably to the cast, Ermey in particular,    and the films first act in recruit training,   but several reviews were critical of the latter part of the film set in Vietnam and what was considered a "muddled" moral message in the finale.   It ranks #95 on AFIs 100 Years... 100 Thrills. 

Richard Corliss of Time (magazine)|TIME called the film a "technical knockout", praising "the dialogues wild, desperate wit; the daring in choosing a desultory skirmish to make a point about wars pointlessness", and "the fine, large performances of almost every actor", believing, at the time, that Ermey and DOnofrio would receive Oscar nominations. Corliss also appreciated "the Olympian elegance and precision of Kubricks filmmaking".  Empire (film magazine)|Empire s Ian Nathan awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying it is "inconsistent" and describing it as "both powerful and frustratingly unengaged". Nathan felt that after leaving the opening act following the recruit training, the film becomes "bereft of purpose", but he summarized his review by calling it a "hardy Kubrickian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings". Nathan also praised Ermeys "staggering performance".  Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it "harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric". Canby echoed praise for Ermey, calling him "the films stunning surprise...hes so good - so obsessed - that you might think he wrote his own lines". Canby also said DOnofrios performance should be noted with "admiration", and he called Modine "one of the best, most adaptable young film actors of his generation". Canby concluded: Full Metal Jacket was "a film of immense and very rare imagination". 

Jim Hall, writing for   as one of Kubricks very best."  Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called it "Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes...and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since Dr. Strangelove, as well as the most horrific."  Variety (magazine)|Variety called the film an "intense, schematic, superbly made" drama "loaded with vivid, outrageously vulgar military vernacular that contributes heavily to the films power," but felt that it never develops "a particularly strong narrative." The cast performances were all labeled "exceptional" with Modine being singled out as "embodying both what it takes to survive in the war and a certain omniscience."   Gilbert Adair, writing in a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that "Kubricks approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". 

Not all reviews were positive.   also disliked the film saying "Kubricks direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the régime it depicts," and felt that the characters were underdeveloped, adding "we never really get to know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view." 

British television channel Channel 4 voted it number 5 on its list of the greatest war films ever made.  In 2008, Empire (film magazine)|Empire placed Full Metal Jacket number 457 on its list of the The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.
