Natural Born Killers is a 1994 American crime film directed by Oliver Stone and starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey, Jr., Tom Sizemore, and Tommy Lee Jones. The film was released in the United States on August 26, 1994. The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who became lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.

The film is based on an original screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by writer David Veloz, associate producer Richard Rutowski, and director Stone. Tarantino received story credit. Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with Arnon Milchan, Thom Mount, and Stone as executive producers.

Notorious for its violent content and inspiring "copycat" crimes, the film was named the eighth most controversial film of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2006. 

==Plot==
===Prologue=== Mickey Knox Mallory stop sexually harassing Mallory. She briefly encourages him before beating him to a pulp. Mickey and Mallory then murder all but one of the diners patrons, culminating in a morbid game of Eeny, meeny, miny, moe to decide who lives and dies. After executing the waitress Mabel, the couple ensures that the only survivor remembers their names before they embrace and declare their undying love.

===Part I=== flashback (done sexually abusive grand theft auto, but he subsequently escapes from a prison work farm during a tornado and returns to Mallorys house. The two kill Mallorys parents, but spare Kevin, and go on the road together and get "married" on the side of a bridge, celebrating by taking a hostage. Furious with Mickeys notion that they have a threesome, Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with the mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but Mallory kills him when he recognizes her as a wanted killer. During this time, Mickey rapes the hostage.

===Part II=== Wayne Gale. Gale profiles Mickey and Mallory on his show, American Maniacs, soon elevating them to cult hero status.
 Navajo Indian, and his young grandson. After the two fall asleep, the Navajo, hoping to expel the demon he perceives in Mickey, begins chanting beside the fire, invoking nightmares in Mickey about his abusive parents. Mickey wakes up in a rage and fatally shoots Red Cloud before he realizes what he is doing. It is the first time Mallory and Mickey feel guilty for a murder. Fleeing from the scene through the desert, they stray onto a field of rattlesnakes and are both bitten.
 snakebite antidote, but the pharmacist sets off the silent alarm before Mickey kills him. Soon police cars arrive and Mallory is captured and subsequently beaten by the police. A gunfight breaks out between Mickey and the others. Scagnetti arrives and tells Mickey that unless he surrenders, he will cut off Mallorys breasts. Mickey gives up his guns, but attacks Scagnetti with a knife. The police taser him and the scene ends with Mickey and Mallory being beaten by a group of vengeful policemen as a Japanese news crew fronted by a female reporter films the action.

===Part III=== mental hospital after being declared insane. Scagnetti arrives at the prison and encounters Warden Dwight McClusky, with whom he plans to murder the two criminals. McClusky will arrange for Scagnetti to be the driver for the Knoxes transfer. Alone with the pair, Scagnetti will murder them, then claim that they tried to escape.

Meanwhile, Gale has persuaded Mickey to agree to a live interview that will air immediately after the Super Bowl. Mallory is held in solitary confinement elsewhere in the prison, awaiting her transport to the mental hospital. During the interview, Mickey gives a speech about how murder provides enlightenment and declares himself a "natural born killer". His words inspire the other inmates (who are watching the interview on TV in the recreation room) and incite them to riot.

McClusky, upon learning of the riot, orders the interview terminated despite Gales vehement protests. Mickey is left alone with Gale, the film crew and several guards. Using a lengthy joke as a diversion, Mickey overpowers a guard and grabs his shotgun. He kills most of the guards with it and takes the survivors hostage, leading them through the prison riot. Gale follows, giving a live television report as people are beaten and killed around him.

Scagnetti enters Mallorys cell and attempts to seduce her. Mallory rebuffs his efforts, smashing his face against the wall and breaking his nose. The guards and Scagnetti subdue her. Still live on national television, Mickey engages in a Mexican standoff with Scagnetti, eventually feigning a concession. Mallory then approaches Scagnetti from behind and slashes his throat with a Shiv (weapon)|shank. To Scagnettis horror, Mickey tells him that he was out of shotgun shells during the standoff. Mallory then picks up Scagnettis gun and kills him.
 posse of guards. The trio takes cover in a blood-splattered shower room. McClusky threatens to storm the shower room; Mickey, in turn, threatens to kill both Gale and a guard on live TV, and the prisoners walk out the front door. McClusky and his guards are quickly massacred by hordes of inmates.

Mickey and Mallory steal a van and kill the last guard; Owens fate is unknown. Escaping to a rural location, they give a final interview to Gale, whose penis they have seemingly removed (implied, but as a camera track reveals), before they tell him he must die also. He attempts various arguments to change their minds, finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor; Mickey informs him they are leaving a witness to tell the tale, his camera. Gale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if on a cross as they shoot him dead while his unattended camera continues to roll. The couple is shown several years later, in an Recreational vehicle|RV, with Mickey driving and a pregnant Mallory watching their two children play.

==Production== Warner Bros. Heaven & Earth; a difficult shoot which had left him exhausted, and he felt that Natural Born Killers could be what he was looking for.   
 WGA rules, Tarantino was credited for the films story only. In a 1993 interview, Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone, and that he wished the film well;  "Its not going to be my movie, its going to be Oliver Stones, and God bless him. I hope he does a good job with it. If I wasnt emotionally attached to it, Im sure I would find it very interesting. If you like my stuff, you might not like this movie. But if you like his stuff, youre probably going to love it. It might be the best thing hes ever done, but not because of anything to do with me.   I actually cant wait to see it, to tell you the truth."  
 Indian cinema.  Rodney Dangerfield wrote or rewrote all of his lines.   

During pre-production, to prepare for the role of Wayne Gale, Downey spent time with Australian TV shock-king Steve Dunleavy, and later convinced Stone to allow him to portray Gale with an Australian accent. Also during pre-production, Stone tried to convince actress Juliette Lewis to bulk up for the role of Mallory so that she looked tougher, but she refused, saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover, not a bodybuilder.   
 POV scene Robert Richardson broke his finger and the replacement cameraman cut his eye. According to Oliver Stone, he wasn’t too popular with the camera department on set that day.  For the scenes involving rear projection, the projected footage was shot prior to principal photography, then edited together, and projected onto the stage, behind the live actors. For example, when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall, this was shot live using footage projected onto the facade of a real building. 

The famous Coca-Cola polar bear ad  is seen twice during the film. According to Stone, Coca-Cola approved the use of the ad without having a full idea of what the film was about. When they saw the completed film, they were furious. 

The films soundtrack was produced by Stone and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who reportedly watched the film over fifty times to "get in the mood".  Reznor reportedly produced the soundtrack while on tour.   On his approach to compiling the soundtrack, Reznor told MTV:
 Oliver   to try to turn the soundtrack into a collage-of-sound, kind of the way the movie used music: make edits, add dialog, and make it something interesting, rather than a bunch of previously released music.  

Some songs were written especially for the film or soundtrack, such as "Burn (Nine Inch Nails song)|Burn" by Nine Inch Nails.

==Style== psychedelic style consisting of black and white, animation, and other unusual color schemes, and employing a wide range of camera angles, filters, lenses and special effects. Much of the film is told via parodies of television shows, including a scene (I Love Mallory) presented in the style of a sitcom about a dysfunctional family. Commercials which were commonly on the air at the time of the films release make brief, intermittent appearances. In his DVD directors commentary, Stone goes into great detail about the look of the film, explaining scene by scene why a particular look was chosen for a particular scene.
 Bonnie and Bonnie and Clyde used innovative editing techniques provided by multiple cameras shot from different angles at different speeds; this sporadic interchange between fast-paced and slow-motion editing that concludes Arthur Penns film is used throughout the entirety of Natural Born Killers. 
 Bonnie and Bonnie and Clyde, the polices ambush of the couple exhibits the empirical control of law enforcement over the individual. Natural Born Killers, however, ends with the couple symbolically destroying the mass media, as represented by Wayne Gale, and successfully fleeing together to live a relatively "normal" life. As Stone himself says, "In its own way, Natural Born Killers is ultimately a very optimistic film about the future. Its about freedom, and the ability of every human being to get it." 

==Release==
===Box office===
 
In its opening weekend, Natural Born Killers grossed a total of $11,166,687 in 1,510 theaters. As of January 12, 2007, the film has grossed a total of $50,282,766 domestically,  compared to its $34 million budget. 

===Critical response===
The film received a mixed to positive critical response. As of April 7, 2015, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes records an average response of 46%, based on 35 reviews. However, Metacritic records a score of 74 out of 100 based on 20 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, "Seeing this movie once is not enough. The first time is for the visceral experience, the second time is for the meaning."  On his television show, his partner Gene Siskel agreed with him, adding extra praise to the scene featuring Rodney Dangerfield.

Other critics found the film unsuccessful in its aims. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post claimed that "Stones sensibility is white-hot and personal. As much as hed like us to believe that his camera is turned outward on the culture, its vividly clear that he cant resist turning it inward on himself. This wouldnt be so troublesome if Stone didnt confuse the public and the private."  Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, "for all its surface passions, Natural Born Killers never digs deep enough to touch the madness of such events, or even to send them up in any surprising way. Mr. Stones vision is impassioned, alarming, visually inventive, characteristically overpowering. But its no match for the awful truth." 

James Berardinelli gave the film a negative review but his criticism was different from many other such pans, which generally said that Oliver Stone was a hypocrite for making an ultra-violent film in the guise of a critique of American attitudes. Berardinelli noted that the movie "hits the bullseye" as a satire of Americas lust for bloodshed, but repeated Stones main point so often and so loudly that it became unbearable.
 Lionsgate Films released a directors cut on DVD. Stone himself retained ownership of his preferred cut. Distribution rights to the directors cut reverted from Lionsgate to Warner Bros. in 2009, giving Warner all distribution rights.

==Controversies==
===Censorship===
When the film was first handed in to the Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA, they told Stone they would give it an Motion Picture Association of America#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17 unless he cut it. As such, Stone toned down the violence by cutting approximately four minutes of footage, and the MPAA re-rated the film as an R. In 1996, a Directors Cut was released on home video by Vidmark Entertainment and Pioneer Entertainment, as Warner Bros. wanted nothing to do with that particular version.  Warner Home Video later released this cut on Blu-ray. 

The film was banned completely in Ireland, although it has since been unbanned.      

In the UK, though the cinema release was delayed while the BBFC investigated reports that the film caused copycat murders in the USA and France,  it was finally shown in cinemas in February 1995.
 Channel Five showed the film in November 1997. It was finally released on video in July 2001. 

Stone has continually maintained that the film is a satire on how serial killers are adored by the media for their horrific actions and that those who claim that the violence in the film itself is a cause of societal violence miss the point of the film. 

Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as the eighth most controversial film ever. 

===Copycat crimes===
 
From almost the moment of its release, the film has been accused of encouraging and inspiring numerous murderers in North America, including the Heath High School shooting and the Columbine High School massacre.
