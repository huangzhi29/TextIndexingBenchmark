 Bray Studios and on location at an old country estate named Oakley Court, best known for its use in old Hammer Horror productions. A number of props and set pieces were reused from old Hammer films. Although the movie is both a send-up and tribute to many of the science fiction and horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1970s, costume designer Sue Blane conducted no research for her designs. Blane stated that costumes from the film have directly impacted the development of punk music fashion trends such as ripped fishnets and dyed hair.
 a large international cult following and is one of the most well-known and financially successful midnight movies of all time. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2005.

The story centers on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is Frank N. Furter, an apparent mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple is seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control. The films creative team also produced Shock Treatment in 1981, a stand-alone movie using the characters of Brad and Janet and featuring some of the same cast. This second feature film was produced as a musical stage production for a 2015 premier on the London stage.

==Plot== transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania". The ensemble of convention attendees also includes servants Riff Raff, his sister Magenta, and a groupie named Columbia.

In his lab, Frank claims to have discovered the "secret to life itself". His creation, Rocky, is brought to life. The ensuing celebration is soon interrupted by Eddie, (an ex-delivery boy, both Frank and Columbias ex-lover, as well as partial brain donor to Rocky) who rides out of a deep freeze on a motorcycle. In a jealous rage, Frank corners him and kills him with an ice axe. He then departs with Rocky to a bridal suite.

Brad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms where each is visited and seduced by Frank, who poses as Brad (when visiting Janet) and then as Janet (when visiting Brad). Janet, upset and emotional, wanders off to look for Brad, whom she discovers, via a television monitor, is in bed with Frank. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank, hiding from Riff Raff, who has been tormenting him. While tending to his wounds, Janet becomes intimate with Rocky, as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.
 UFOs for the government. Upon learning of Brad and Janets connection to Dr. Scott, Frank suspects them of working for him. Frank, Dr. Scott, Brad, and Riff Raff then discover Janet and Rocky together under the sheets in Rockys birth tank, upsetting Frank and Brad. Magenta interrupts the reunion by sounding a massive gong and stating that dinner is prepared.

Rocky and the guests share an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realize has been prepared from Eddies mutilated remains. Janet runs screaming into Rockys arms and is slapped and chased through the halls of the castle by a jealous Frank. Janet, Brad, Dr. Scott, Rocky, and Columbia all meet in Franks lab, where Frank captures them with the Sonic Transducer which Dr. Scott believes is a transport device.  When Frank feels up Janet, Brad gets infuriated and swings his fists at him. After Janet is able to make him stop, Frank then makes Magenta use the Medusa device, transforming them into statues. They are then forced to perform a live cabaret floor show with Frank as the leader.

Riff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance, revealing themselves and Frank to be aliens from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. They stage a coup and announce a plan to return to their home world. In the process, they kill Columbia, Rocky, and Frank, who has "failed his mission." They release Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, then depart by lifting off in the castle itself. The survivors are then left crawling in the dirt, and the narrator concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planets surface.

==Production==
===Concept and development===
  British citizen B horror movies. He wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, Steve Reeves muscle flicks and fifties rock and roll into his musical.   
 Brian Thomson. Michael White was also brought in to produce. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title, They Came from Denton High, was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to The Rocky Horror Show.   Originally presented in a small sixty-seat theatre, it quickly moved to larger venues.   
 Roxy Theatre Broadway at the 1,000-seat Belasco Theatre.   

===Filming and locations===
  Bray Studios, and Oakley Court, a country house in Berkshire, England and Elstree Studios    for post production,  from 21 October to 19 December 1974. Oakley Court, built in 1857 in the Victorian Gothic Architectural style|style, is known for a number of Hammer films.     Much of the location shooting took place there, although at the time the manor was not in good condition.    Fox insisted on casting the two characters of Brad and Janet with American actors, Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon.     Filming took place during autumn, which made conditions worse, and during filming, Sarandon fell ill with pneumonia.  Filming of the laboratory scene and the title characters creation occurred on 30 October 1974. 

The movie is both a send-up and tribute to many of the science fiction and horror movies from the 1930s up to the 1970s.    The film production retains many aspects from the stage version such as production design and music, but adds new scenes not featured in the original stage play.    The films plot, setting, and style echo those of the Hammer Horror films, which had their own instantly recognizable style (just as Universal Studios horror films did).  The originally proposed opening sequence was to contain clips of various films mentioned in the lyrics, as well as the first few sequences shot in black and white, but this was deemed too expensive, and scrapped.   

===Costumes, make-up and props===
In the stage productions, actors generally did their own makeup. However, for the film, the producers chose Pierre La Roche, who had previously been a makeup artist for Mick Jagger, to redesign the makeup for each character.  Production stills were taken by rock photographer Mick Rock, who has published a number of books from his work.  In "Rocky Horror; From Concept to Cult", designer Sue Blane discusses the Rocky Horror costumes influence on punk music style. "  big part of the build up  ." She states that ripped fishnet stockings, glitter and coloured hair were directly attributable to Rocky Horror. 

Some of the costumes from the film had been originally used in the stage production. Props and set pieces were reused from old Hammer productions and others. The tank and dummy used for Rockys birth originally appeared in "The Revenge of Frankenstein." These references to older productions, in addition to cutting costs, enhanced the cult status of the film.   

Costume designer Sue Blane wasnt keen on designing for the film until she realized Curry, an old friend, was doing the show. Tim and Blane had worked together in Glasgows Citizen Theatre in a production of "The Maids", where Curry had worn a womans corset in the production. Blane arranged it with the theatre to loan her the corset from the other production for Rocky Horror.    Blane admits that she did not conduct research for her designing and had never seen a science fiction film, and is acutely aware that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.

The budget for the films costumes was $1600,  far more than the stage production budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming such as Columbias gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magentas maids uniform. 

Costume designer Sue Blane was amazed by the recreation and understanding of her designs by fans.  When she first heard that people were dressing up, she thought it would be tacky, but she was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston‚Äôs performance group, states that "the best part is when everyone leaves with a big smile on their face", noting that theres "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you".  The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.

==Release==
  Samuels (1983), p. 11  Fox re-released the film around college campuses on a double-bill with another rock music film parody, Brian De Palmas Phantom of the Paradise, but again it drew small audiences. 
 cult following started shortly after the film began its midnight run at the Waverly Theater in New York City.    Rocky Horror was not only found in the larger cities but throughout the United States where many attendees would get in free if they arrived in costume. The western division of the films release included The U.A. Cinema in Fresno and Merced, California|Merced, The Cinema J in Sacramento, California and the Covell in Modesto. In New Orleans, an early organized performance group was active with the release there as well as in such cities as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Chicago (at the Biograph Theater). Before long nearly every screening of the film was accompanied by a live fan cast.   

The film is considered to be the longest-running release in film history.    It has never been pulled by 20th Century Fox from its original 1975 release, and it continues to play in cinemas.      

===Home media=== Super 8 image transfer from the original camera negative. In addition, new content featuring karaoke and a fan performance were included. 

==Reception and reaction==
===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert noted that when first released, The Rocky Horror Picture Show was "ignored by pretty much everyone, including the future fanatics who would eventually count the hundreds of times theyd seen it".  He considered it more a "long-running social phenomenon" than a movie, rating it 2.5 out of 4 stars.  Bill Henkin noted that Variety (magazine)|Variety thought that the "campy hijinks" of the film seemed labored, and also mentioned that the San Francisco Chronicle s John Wasserman, who had liked the stage play in London, found the film "lacking both charm and dramatic impact". Newsweek called the movie "Tasteless, plotless and pointless" in 1978.   
 Time Out noted that the "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Grays admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars.  Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader on the other hand considered the wit to be "too weak to sustain a film", and thought that the "songs all sound the same". 

In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".  

===Cult phenomenon===
 
====New York City origins====
  shadowing the film above.       
The performances of the audience was scripted and actively discouraged improvising, being conformist in a similar way to the repressed characters.   

On Halloween in 1976, people attended in costume and talked back to the screen, and by mid-1978, Rocky Horror was playing in over 50 locations on Fridays and Saturdays at midnight. Newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for Rocky Horror conventions.  By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres.  The National Fan Club was established in 1977 and later merged with the International Fan Club. A publication, "The Transylavanian" printed a number of issues, and a semi-regular poster magazine was published as well as an official magazine.   

====Los Angeles, Hollywood====
 
The Los Angeles area performance groups originated in 1977 at the Fox Theatre, where Michael Wolfson won a look-alike contest as Frank N. Furter, and won another at the Tiffany Theater on Sunset Boulevard. Wolfsons group eventually performed in all of the LA area theaters screening Rocky Horror, including the Balboa Theater in Balboa, The Cove at Hermosa Beach and The Sands in Glendale, California|Glendale. He was invited to perform at the Sombrero Playhouse in Phoenix, Arizona.

At the Tiffany Theatre, the audience performance cast had the theaters full cooperation; the local performers entered early and without charge. The fan playing Frank for this theatre was a transgender performer.    D. Garret Gafford, was out of work in 1978, trying to raise enough funds for a sex change operation while spending the weekends performing at the Tiffany. 

====San Francisco====
  Tenderloin on Market Street. Berkeley group, disbanded due to less than enthusiastic management. Their Frank N. Furter was portrayed by Marni Scofidio, who, in 1979, attracted many of the older groups from Berkeley. Other members included Mishell Erickson and her twin sister Denise Erickson who portrayed Columbia and Magenta, Kathy Dolan playing Janet and Linda Woods as Riff Raff. The Strand group had performed at two large science fiction conventions in Los Angeles and San Francisco. They were offered a spot at The Mabuhay, a local punk club, and even performed for childrens television of Argentina.   

====Fan following====
Rocky Horror is one of the last few western rites left that pertain to the carnivalesque.    Annual Rock Horror conventions are held in varying locations lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has been host a number of times, including 1999 with ‚ÄúEl Fishnet Fiesta‚Äù, and ‚ÄúQueens of the Desert‚Äù held in 2006.  To the fans, Rocky Horror is ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home and coming back to see the film each weekend.    The audience call backs are similar to responses in church during a mass.   

The film has a global following and remains popular well into the 21st century.    Sub cultures such as Rocky Horror have also found a place on the internet.    Audience participation scripts for many cities are available to download from the World Wide Web.    The internet has a number of Rocky Horror fan run websites with various quizzes and information specializing in different content allowing fans to participate at a unique level.    New technologies are allowing for more personal access to all the things surrounding the cult. What would have been printed in a magazine are now available off the net.   

==Sequels==
  theatrical film poster from 1981]]
In 1981, Sharman reunited with OBrien to do Shock Treatment, a stand-alone feature that was not a direct sequel to the original film.  This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actors Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.   
 bootleg copies can be read on the Internet. The script is currently owned by Fox, which produced the two original films. Most individuals associated with the project, including OBrien, agree that the film will probably never be made, owing to the failure of Shock Treatment and the aging of the cast. 

In 2014, it was announced that OBrien would produce "Shock Treatment" for the theatrical stage. The production will premiere at the King‚Äôs Head theatre in Islington, London in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2015. 

==Cultural impact== Vice Squad, Halloween II, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower.  The 1980 film Fame (1980 film)|Fame featured the audience reciting their callback lines to the screen and dancing the Time Warp,    the dance from the stage show and film, which has become a common novelty dance at parties.   
 second season cameo roles. 

Rocky Horror remains a cultural phenomenon in both the U.S. and U.K.       Cult film participants are often people on the fringe of society that find connection and community at the screenings    although the film attracts fans of differing backgrounds all over the world.   
 reimagining of the film, tentatively titled The Rocky Horror Picture Show Event, in the fall of 2015.
