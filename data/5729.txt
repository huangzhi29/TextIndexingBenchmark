 Best Picture Best Screenplay. Top 100 instrumental theme tune by Vangelis, who won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

The films title was inspired by the line, "Bring me my chariot of fire," from the   and   in the Bible.

==Plot== Trinity Great Court Run – running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12. Abrahams achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil (Alice Krige).

Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) disapproves of Liddells plans to pursue competitive running. But Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.

When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters (John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to "play the tradesman" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice. 

When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, "I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."
 1924 Olympics Prince of Wales and the British Olympic committee – because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath.
 400 metre race on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.

Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris  , ending with:

:But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddells race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.

The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.

== Historical accuracy ==

=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending  , Aubrey Montague, and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.   at SportsReference.com  Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montagues narration in the film.
 Lord Burghley, Douglas Lowe, who was Britains third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film. 
 Great Court Run.]] Great Court Great Court Lord Burghley, in 1927. In Chariots of Fire, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the films release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007. 

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400 metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20 metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at Stoke-on-Trent in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.  Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to Sam Mussabini.  This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabinis assistance.

Abrahams fiancée is misidentified as Sybil Gordon, a soprano at the DOyly Carte Opera Company.  In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married Sybil Evers, who sang at the DOyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934. Ryan (2012), p. 188.   Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in The Mikado, but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with DOyly Carte,   although Evers was known for her charm in singing Peep-Bo, one of the two other "little maids from school".  Harold Abrahams love of and heavy involvement with Gilbert and Sullivan, as depicted in the film, is factual. Hugh Hudsons commentary to the 2005 Chariots of Fire DVD 

Liddells sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddells track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris Church of Scotland during Liddells sermon. 

At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and Aubrey Montague are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams death.

===1924 Olympics===
 

The film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddells refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesnt learn that the 100 metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance. Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other grandees;  and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.  The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddells success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400 metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400 metre race for Liddell. In fact David Burghley|Burghley, on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.

The film reverses the order of Abrahams 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the 200 metres but finished last, Jackson Scholz taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and Charlie Paddock with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting "beaten out of sight" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.
 AAA Championship in the film was fictitious, though Liddells record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder. 

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the 4 x 100 metres relay team, not shown in the film. Aubrey Montague placed sixth in the steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase, as depicted. 

====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics==== Arthur Porritt of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty. His wish was accepted by the films producers, even though his permission was not necessary.  However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the University of Oxford, substantially matches Porritts history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: "It says in the good Book, He that honors me, I will honor. Good luck."   In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the teams Paris hotel. Reid, Alasdair. "Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell". The Times. 1 August 2000.  For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying "Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good."  

== Production ==
=== Script and direction ===
 , who studied the Bible intensively for his role, wrote Eric Liddells post-race inspirational speech to a working-class crowd.]] A Man for All Seasons (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt sports provided clear situations in this sense.  He discovered Eric Liddells story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the Olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in Los Angeles.  Hugh Hudson in Chariots of Fire – The Reunion (2005 video; featurette on 2005 Chariots of Fire DVD) 

Screenwriter Colin Welland, commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his Academy Award-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film.  Aubrey Montagues son saw Wellands newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home – which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from "Darling Mummy" to "Dear Mum" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montagues letters are from the originals. 
 Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay. 

Ian Charleson himself wrote Eric Liddells speech to the post-race workingmens crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didnt feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead. 
 obscenity – PG rating. 

Puttnam chose  . 10 November 2011. 

===Casting===
Director Hugh Hudson was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer David Puttnam did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor Ian Charleson performing the role of Pierre in the Royal Shakespeare Companys production of Piaf (play)|Piaf, and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would "fit like a kid glove". 

Ben Cross, who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in Chicago (musical)|Chicago. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano.   Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the films script. Wings on Their Heels: The Making of Chariots of Fire. (2005 video; featurette on 2005 DVD). 
 Midnight Express (also produced by Puttnam), and Dennis Christopher had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film Breaking Away. 

All of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive, with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them. 

=== Music ===
  Chariots of Fire" music scene which bookends the film.]] synthesizer and title theme of the film has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Vangelis, a Greek-born electronic composer who moved to Paris in the late 1960s, had been living in London since 1974.    Director Hugh Hudson had collaborated with him on documentaries and commercials, and was also particularly impressed with his 1979 albums  . February 2012.  
 The Year of Living Dangerously.

Some pieces of Vangeliss music in the film did not end up on the films soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of "Hymn", the original version of which appears on Vangeliss 1979 album,  , though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively  , "Three Little Maids from School Are We" from The Mikado, "With Catlike Tread" from The Pirates of Penzance, "The Soldiers of Our Queen" from Patience (opera)|Patience, and "There Lived a King" from The Gondoliers.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: "And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England. This hymn has been described as "Englands unofficial national anthem",  concludes the film and inspired its title.  A handful of other traditional anthems and hymns and period-appropriate instrumental ballroom-dance music round out the films soundtrack.

===Filming locations===
  Old Course at St Andrews Links.  

All of the Cambridge scenes were actually filmed at Hugh Hudsons alma mater Eton College, because Cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-Semitism. The Cambridge administration greatly regretted the decision after the films enormous success. 
 Olympic Stadium Oval Sports Woodside ferry terminal was used to represent the embarkation scenes set in Dover.  The railway station scenes were filmed at the National Railway Museum in York.  The scene depicting a performance of The Mikado was filmed in the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool with members of the DOyly Carte Opera Company who were on tour. 

==Revival for the 2012 Olympics==
  stage adaptation: Stars Jack Lowden and James McArdle flank Vangelis, watching the Olympic Torch Relay set to the iconic tune, from the Gielgud Theatre, July 2012.]] The Suns Olympic Park Olympic flame Opening Ceremony of the games; the performance was accompanied by a comedy skit by Rowan Atkinson (in persona as Mr. Bean) which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.    The films theme tune was also played during each medal ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.

===Stage adaptation===
  Chariots of Mike Bartlett West End Edward Hall directed. Stage designer Miriam Buether transformed each theatre into an Olympic stadium, and composer Jason Carr wrote additional music.    Vangelis also created several new pieces of music for the production.   The stage version for the London Olympic year was the idea of the films director, Hugh Hudson, who co-produced the play; he stated, "Issues of faith, of refusal to compromise, standing up for ones beliefs, achieving something for the sake of it, with passion, and not just for fame or financial gain, are even more vital today." 

Another play, Running for Glory, written by Philip Dart, based on the 1924 Olympics, and focusing on Abrahams and Liddell, toured parts of Britain from 25 February to 1 April 2012. It starred Nicholas Jacobs as Harold Abrahams, and Tom Micklem as Eric Liddell.  

===UK cinematic re-release, Blu-ray===
As an official part of the London 2012 Festival celebrations, a new digitally re-mastered version of the film screened in 150 cinemas throughout the UK. The re-release began 13 July 2012, two weeks before the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. 

A Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray of the film was released on 10 July 2012 in North America,  and was released 16 July 2012 in the UK.  The release includes nearly an hour of special features, a CD sampler, and a 32-page "digibook".
