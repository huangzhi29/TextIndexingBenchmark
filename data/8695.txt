 Peter Georges thriller novel Red Alert.
 nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. It follows the President of the United States, his advisers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. It separately follows the crew of one B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber as they try to deliver their payload.

In 1989, the United States Library of Congress included it in the first group of films selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was listed as number three on AFIs 100 Years...100 Laughs list.

==Plot== Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the Strategic Air Command 843rd Bomb Wing, equipped with B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bombers. The 843rd is currently in-flight on airborne alert, a few hours from the Soviet border.

 
 executive officer, CRM 114 discriminator, which is programmed to transmit only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper.

Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of the United States water supplies to pollute the "precious bodily fluids" of Americans; at this point, Mandrake realizes that Ripper is insane.
 War Room". President Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, but Turgidson reminds him that Plan R—enabling a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on Washington D.C.—allows such an action. Turgidson reports that his men are trying every possible three-letter CRM code to issue the stand-down order, but that this could take over two days and the planes are due to reach their targets in about an hour. Muffley orders the Army chief to storm the base and arrest General Ripper.
 Soviet premier hot line". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the planes positions and targets so that the Russians can protect themselves.
 bombs jacketed with "Cobalt-Thorium G" connected to a computer network set to detonate them automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. Within two months after detonation, the Cobalt-Thorium G would encircle the earth in a radioactive cloud, wiping out all human and animal life, rendering the surface of the earth uninhabitable for 93 years. The device cannot be dismantled or "un-triggered", as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. When the Presidents wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, former Nazi Dr. Strangelove (again, Peter Sellers), points out that such a doomsday device would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it, de Sadeski replies that the Russian Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week.

 

Meanwhile, United States Army forces arrive at Burpelson, which is still sealed by General Rippers order. A bloody battle ensues, and the Army forces eventually take over the base. Ripper kills himself, fearing he will be tortured into revealing the recall code. A soldier named Colonel "Bat" Guano (Keenan Wynn) forces his way into Rippers office, where Mandrake identifies Rippers CRM code from his desk blotter ("OPE," a variant of both Peace on Earth and Purity of Essence).    Mandrake relays this code to the Pentagon with difficulty via payphone, the only working method of communication. Using the recall code, SAC successfully recalls most of the aircraft; however, Muffley learns that a surface-to-air missile has ruptured the fuel tank of Major Kongs plane and destroyed its communications device, making it impossible to recall this particular plane even with the correct recall code. President Muffley tells the Soviets the planes target to help them find it, but doesnt realize that, because of the shortened range of the crippled aircraft, Major Kong has selected a closer target. When the plane approaches the new target, its damaged bomb doors fail to open at first. Major Kong adjusts the wiring, whereupon the doors open and the nuclear bomb falls with Kong straddling it, and detonates, triggering the doomsday machine.

Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people, with a high female-to-male ratio (10:1), to live in deep mineshafts where the radiation will not penetrate and then institute a breeding program to repopulate the Earth when the radiation has subsided. Turgidson warns that the Soviets will likely do the same and worries about a "mineshaft gap". The film then cuts to a montage of nuclear detonations, accompanied by Vera Lynns recording of "Well Meet Again".

===Peter Sellerss multiple roles=== The Mouse That Roared (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later explaining that "such crass and grotesque stipulations are the sine qua non of the motion-picture business."  Lee Hill,  : interview with Terry Southern

Sellers ended up playing three of the four roles written for him. He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. "King" Kong, the B-52 Stratofortress aircraft commander, but from the beginning Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy and he worried he would not properly portray the characters Texas accent. Kubrick pleaded with him and asked screenwriter Terry Southern (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kongs lines spoken in the correct accent. Using Southerns tape, Sellers managed to get the accent right, and started shooting the scenes in the airplane, but then Sellers sprained an ankle and could not work in the cramped cockpit set.   
 improvised much of his dialogue, with Kubrick incorporating the ad-libs into the written screenplay so that the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as retroscripting. "Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove," a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film    

; Group Captain Lionel Mandrake Alexander Walker, the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of Group Captain Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, as he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the RAF during World War II.   There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellerss friend and occasional co-star Terry-Thomas and prosthetic-limbed RAF ace Douglas Bader.

; President Merkin Muffley Adlai Stevenson, 1952 and 1956 presidential elections and the U.N. ambassador during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
 cold symptoms to emphasize the characters apparent weakness. This caused frequent laughter among the film crew, ruining several takes. Kubrick ultimately found this comic portrayal inappropriate, feeling that Muffley should be a serious character.   In later takes Sellers played the role straight, though the Presidents cold is still evident in several scenes.

In keeping with Kubricks satirical character names, a "merkin" is a pubic hair wig. The president is bald, and his last name is "Muffley"; both are additional homages to a merkin.

; Dr. Strangelove Nazi scientist, suggesting Operation Paperclip, the US effort to recruit top German technical talent at the end of World War II.   He serves as President Muffleys scientific adviser in the War Room. When General Turgidson wonders aloud what kind of name "Strangelove" is, saying to Mr. Staines (Jack Creley) that it is not a "Kraut name," Staines responds that Strangeloves original German surname was "Merkwürdigliebe," without mentioning that "Merkwürdigliebe" translates to "Strangelove" in English. Twice in the film, Strangelove "accidentally" addresses the president as "Mein Führer". Dr. Strangelove did not appear in the book Red Alert. 

  proposed the strategy of mutual assured destruction]]

The character is an amalgamation of RAND Corporation strategist Herman Kahn, mathematician and Manhattan Project principal John von Neumann, rocket scientist Wernher von Braun (a central figure in Nazi Germanys rocket development program recruited to the US after the war), and Edward Teller, the "father of the hydrogen bomb."  There is a common misconception that the character was based on Henry Kissinger, but Kubrick and Sellers denied this; http://www.moviediva.com/MD_root/reviewpages/MDDrStrangelove.htm  Sellers said, "Strangelove was never modeled after Kissinger—thats a popular misconception. It was always Wernher Von Braun." 
 Alexander Walker, Sellers improvised Dr. Strangeloves lapse into the Nazi salute, borrowing one of Kubricks black leather gloves for the uncontrollable hand that makes the gesture. Dr. Strangelove apparently suffers from diagnostic apraxia (alien hand syndrome). Kubrick wore the gloves on the set to avoid being burned when handling hot lights, and Sellers, recognizing the potential connection to Langs work, found them to be menacing. 
 

===Slim Pickens as Major T. J. "King" Kong===
 
  of the Bonanza western television series was approached to play the part, but according to Terry Southern|Southern, Blockers agent rejected the script as being "too pinko."  Kubrick then recruited Pickens, whom he knew from Pickenss work in Marlon Brandos One-Eyed Jacks. 

Fellow actor James Earl Jones recalls, "He was Major Kong on and off the set—he didnt change a thing—his temperament, his language, his behavior." Pickens was not told that the movie was a comedy and was only given the script for scenes he was in, to get him to play it "straight." 

Kubrick biographer John Baxter explains, in the documentary Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove: As it turns out, Slim Pickens had never left the United States. He had to hurry and get his first passport. He arrived on the set, and somebody said, "Gosh, hes arrived in costume!," not realizing that thats how he always dressed&nbsp;... with the cowboy hat and the fringed jacket and the cowboy boots—and that he wasnt putting on the character—thats the way he talked. 

Pickens, who had previously played only minor supporting and character roles, said his appearance as Maj. Kong greatly improved his career. He later commented, "After Dr. Strangelove the roles, the dressing rooms and the checks all started getting bigger." 

===George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson===
 
Kubrick tricked Scott into playing the role of Gen. Turgidson far more ridiculously than Scott was comfortable doing. Kubrick talked Scott into doing over the top "practice" takes, which Kubrick told Scott would never be used, as a way to warm up for the "real" takes. Kubrick used these takes in the final film, causing Scott to swear never to work with Kubrick again. 

During the filming, Kubrick and Scott had different opinions regarding certain scenes, but Kubrick got Scott to conform largely by repeatedly beating him at chess, which they played frequently on the set.  Scott, a skilled player himself, later said that while he and Kubrick may not have always seen eye to eye, he respected Kubrick immensely for his skill at chess.

==Production==

===Novel and screenplay=== Alastair Buchan Institute for Red Alert Peter George. game theorist and future Nobel Prize in Economics winner Thomas Schelling in an article written for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and reprinted in The Observer,  and immediately bought the film rights. Terry Southern, , article written in 1963 for Esquire but unpublished at the time  In 2006, Schelling wrote that conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George in late 1960 about a treatment of Red Alert updated with intercontinental missiles eventually led to the making of the film. 

In collaboration with George, Kubrick started writing a screenplay based on the book. While writing the screenplay, they benefited from some brief consultations with Schelling and, later,   as he wrote the first draft. Kubrick said: My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working on the screenplay. I found that in trying to put meat on the bones and to imagine the scenes fully, one had to keep leaving out of it things which were either absurd or paradoxical, in order to keep it from being funny; and these things seemed to be close to the heart of the scenes in question.  
 The Magic Christian, which Kubrick had received as a gift from Peter Sellers, Terry Southern,  , Grand Street, issue #49  and which itself became a Sellers film in 1969.

===Sets and filming===
Dr. Strangelove was filmed at  , the production designer of several James Bond in film|James Bond films (at the time he had already worked on Dr. No (film)|Dr. No). The black and white cinematography was by Gilbert Taylor, and the film was edited by Anthony Harvey and Stanley Kubrick (uncredited). The original musical score for the film was composed by Laurie Johnson and the special effects were by Wally Veevers. The theme of the chorus from the bomb run scene is a modification of When Johnny Comes Marching Home. Sellers and Kubrick got on famously during the films production and shared a love of photography. 

 
 

For the War Room, Ken Adam first designed a two-level set which Kubrick initially liked, only to decide later that it was not what he wanted. Adam next began work on the design that was used in the film, an   to force the director of photography to use only the on-set lights from the circle of lamps. Moreover, each lamp in the circle of lights was carefully placed and tested until Kubrick was happy with the result. 
 the Pentagon in the making of the film, the set designers reconstructed the aircraft cockpit to the best of their ability by comparing the cockpit of a B-29 Superfortress and a single photograph of the cockpit of a B-52, and relating this to the geometry of the B-52s fuselage. The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew. When some United States Air Force personnel were invited to view the reconstructed B-52 cockpit, they said that "it was absolutely correct, even to the little black box which was the CRM."  It was so accurate that Kubrick was concerned whether Ken Adams production design team had done all of their research legally, fearing a possible investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI. 

In several shots of the B-52 flying over the polar ice en route to Russia, the shadow of the actual camera plane, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, is visible on the snow below. The B-52 was a scale model composited into the Arctic footage which was sped up to create a sense of jet speed.  Home movie footage included in Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove on the 2001 Special Edition DVD release of the film shows clips of the B-17 with a cursive "Dr. Strangelove" painted over the rear entry hatch on the right side of the fuselage.

===Fail-Safe=== Peter George satirist Terry Candy Jar Books, featuring never-before-published material on Strangeloves early career. 

During the filming of Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick learned that Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe, a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although Fail-Safe was to be an ultra-realistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his films box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel Fail-Safe (on which the film of the same name is based) is so similar to Red Alert that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court.  What worried Kubrick most was that Fail-Safe boasted acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American President and Walter Matthau as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into Fail-Safes production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary, Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove: "We started casting. Fonda was already set&nbsp;... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter   was set&nbsp;... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures."

Kubrick argued that Fail-Safes own 1960 source novel Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe had been plagiarized from Peter Georges Red Alert, to which Kubrick owned creative rights, and pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove. The plan worked, and Fail-Safe opened eight months behind Dr. Strangelove, to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.

===Ending=== Prinz Eugen), which were used as targets, are plainly visible. In others the smoke trails of rockets used to create a calibration backdrop can be seen.
 Goon Show writer, and friend of Sellers, Spike Milligan, was credited with suggesting the Vera Lynn music for the ending.

===Original ending: the pie fight===
 
It was originally planned for the film to end with a scene that was filmed, with everyone in the war room involved in a pie fight.

Accounts vary as to why the pie fight was cut. In a 1969 interview, Kubrick said: "I decided it was   observed that "the cream pies were flying around so thickly that people lost definition, and you couldnt really say whom you were looking at."   Nile Southern, son of screenwriter Terry Southern, suggested the fight was intended to be less jovial. "Since they were laughing, it was unusable, because instead of having that totally black, which would have been amazing, like, this blizzard, which in a sense is metaphorical for all of the missiles that are coming, as well, you just have these guys having a good old time. So, as Kubrick later said, it was a disaster of Homeric proportions."  

===Effects of the Kennedy assassination on the film===
A first test screening of the film was scheduled for November 22, 1963, the day of the John F. Kennedy assassination. The film was just weeks from its scheduled premiere, but because of the assassination the release was delayed until late January 1964, as it was felt that the public was in no mood for such a film any sooner.

One line by Slim Pickens—"a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Dallas with all that stuff"—was dubbed to change "Dallas" to "Las Vegas Valley|Vegas", since Dallas was the city where Kennedy was killed. Eric D. Snider, " "; Seattle Pi, 25 October 2010.   The original reference to Dallas survives in the French-subtitled version of the film.

The assassination also serves as another possible reason why the pie-fight scene was cut. In the scene, after Muffley takes a pie in the face, General Turgidson exclaims: "Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!" Editor Anthony Harvey stated that "  would have stayed, except that Columbia Pictures were horrified, and thought it would offend the presidents family." "No Fighting in the War Room Or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat", a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film  Kubrick and others have said that the scene had been cut earlier because it was not consistent with the rest of the film. 

===1994 re-release===
In 1994 the film was re-released. While the 1964 release used the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the new print was in the slightly squarer 1.66:1 (5:3) ratio that Kubrick had originally intended. 

==Themes==

===Satirizing the Cold War===
Dr. Strangelove takes passing shots at numerous  ", a term coined in 1953 by Kahn and popularized in his 1960 book On Thermonuclear War.

The plan to regenerate the human race from the people sheltered in mineshafts is a parody of Nelson Rockefellers, Edward Tellers, Herman Kahns, and Chet Holifields 1961 plan to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network of concrete-lined underground fallout shelters capable of holding millions of people.  Swiss civil defense network. Switzerland has an overcapacity of nuclear fallout shelters for the countrys population size, and by law, new homes must still be built with a fallout shelter.   If the US did this it would violate the spirit of MAD and destabilize the situation, because the US could launch a first strike and be safe against a retaliatory second strike. See Mutual assured destruction#Theory|Mad--Theory section.

To refute early 1960s novels and Hollywood films like Fail-Safe and Dr. Strangelove which raised questions about U.S. control over nuclear weapons, the Air Force produced a documentary film—SAC Command Post—to demonstrate its responsiveness to presidential command and its tight control over nuclear weapons. 

===Sexual themes===
In the months following the films release director Stanley Kubrick received a fan letter from Legrace G. Benson of the Dept. of History of Art at Cornell University interpreting the film as being sexually-layered. The director wrote back to Benson and confirmed the interpretation, "Seriously, you are the first one who seems to have noticed the sexual framework from intromission (the planes going in) to the last spasm (Kongs ride down and detonation at target)." 

==Reception==
The film was a popular success, earning US$4,420,000 in rentals in North America during its initial theatrical release. 

It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2000 readers of Total Film magazine voted it the 24th greatest comedic film of all time. It holds a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews.  It is ranked number 21 in the All-Time High Scores chart of Metacritics Video/DVD section with an average score of 96.    It is also listed as number 26 on Empire (magazine)#Current List, The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|Empires 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.

Dr. Strangelove is on Roger Eberts list of The Great Movies, Roger Ebert,  , 11 July 1999  described as "arguably the best political satire of the century." It was also rated as the fifth greatest film in the 2002 Sight & Sounds directors poll—the only comedy in the top ten.

==Potential sequel==
In 1995 Kubrick enlisted Terry Southern to script a sequel titled Son of Strangelove. Kubrick had Terry Gilliam in mind to direct. The script was never completed, but index cards laying out the storys basic structure were found among Southerns papers after his October 1995 death; it was set largely in underground bunkers, where Dr. Strangelove had taken refuge with a group of women. In 2013 Gilliam commented: "I was told after Kubrick died—by someone who had been dealing with him—that he had been interested in trying to do another Strangelove with me directing. I never knew about that until after he died but I would have loved to."
