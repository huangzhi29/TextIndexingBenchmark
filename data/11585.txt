 birthday party for her, and Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she was dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes family eats the food made for the party. Elin arrives at Agnes house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to a different party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elins older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare, and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.

After becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up, while Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes house to apologize for how she acted earlier. And in doing so, Elin stops Agnes from attempting to commit suicide. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål, and asks Agnes about being a lesbian, and believes that both of their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, a five-hour car journey away. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. It is while sitting in the back seat together that they first kiss for real. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two sisters, orders them to leave the car.

==Title==
The original title of the film, Fucking Åmål, refers to the girls feelings about their smalltown home: in a key scene one of the girls shouts in desperation "varför måste vi bo i fucking jävla kuk-Åmål?" (which roughly translates to "why do we have to live in fucking Goddamn dick-Åmål?").

* Spanish: Descubriendo el Amor ("discovering love")
* Spanish: Amigas de Colégio ("school friends")
* Czech: Láska je láska ("love is love" )
*Russian: Покажи мне любовь (Pokazhi mne lyobov, "show me love")

==Reception==

===Political controversy===
Even before the film was completed, it created controversy in the town of Åmål itself. Local politicians campaigned to get the title of the film changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way, and even undermine the town as an economic centre.  Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the Film i Väst film studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including Åmål. However, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release of the film the town of Åmål has even tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the towns name is missing from the English title. Still, in the early 2000s the town founded the pop music festival "Fucking Åmål Festival".

===Critical and commercial response===
The film received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998-9, with a total audience of 867,576, and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2,100,000.  However, some reports outside Sweden incorrectly stated that in Sweden the film had even outgrossed the Hollywood film Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic.  In fact, Titanic had over twice as many viewers as Show Me Love in Sweden in 1998.  Based on 39 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of critics gave Show Me Love a positive review.  The film is among the top ten of the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.
