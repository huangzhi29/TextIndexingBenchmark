 television pilot, a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynchs plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynchs version, however, television executives decided to reject it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a feature film. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynchs characteristic style, has left the general meaning of the movies events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline "A love story in the city of dreams". 
 Oscar nomination Best Director. Blue Velvet (1986), and was chosen by 40 critics as one of the greatest films of all time in the decennial Sight & Sound poll. A. O. Scott of The New York Times writes that while some might consider the plot an "offense against narrative order ... the film is an intoxicating liberation from sense, with moments of feeling all the more powerful for seeming to emerge from the murky night world of the unconscious." 

==Plot==
Before the credits begin, a dreamlike jitterbugging scene is shown and ends with a girl (Watts), initially flanked by an elderly couple, stepping forward to take applause; a bed containing a sleeping figure is shown. A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles. Detectives investigating the crash indicate they suspect a woman has made her way down to the city. At daybreak she sneaks into an apartment which an older, red-headed woman is just vacating. In a diner called Winkies, a man tells his companion about a nightmare in which he dreamed there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man to collapse in fright. While the dark-haired woman sleeps, a series of mysterious and sinister phone calls are made concerning her whereabouts.

An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at Los Angeles airport with two accidental traveling companions; they are the trio seen in the opening sequence. The elderly couple is seen leaving in a blacked-out limousine, smiling ominously at each other and staring ahead. Betty arrives at the apartment, her aunts, that the dark-haired woman has entered and assumes she is there with her aunts consent. Betty tells her how happy she is to be in "this dream place". The woman is suffering from amnesia, and assumes the name "Rita" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda, starring Rita Hayworth. Later, hit man Joe Messing (Mark Pellegrino) bungles a hit, leaving three people dead, and steals a book full of phone numbers.
 Monty Montgomery), who tells him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good.

Betty promises to help Rita remember her identity, and the two of them find a large amount of money and an unusual blue key in Ritas purse. Trying to learn more about Ritas accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name "Diane Selwyn". They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition that Rita helped her prepare for, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to the set of a film called The Sylvia North Story, directed by Adam, where Camilla Rhodes gives an audition and Adam declares, "This is the girl." After casting Camilla as the lead, he turns around and looks straight at Betty. Betty flees before she can meet Adam, saying that she promised to meet a friend.

Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyns apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. They have sex that night; Betty tells Rita that she loves her. Later they awake at 2 a.m., when Rita insists they go to an eerie theater called Club Silencio. On stage, a man explains in both Spanish and English that everything is an illusion. He is followed by a woman who sings Roy Orbisons "Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying" a cappella in Spanish; she collapses mid-song and the vocals continue, revealing that she was lip-syncing. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Ritas key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor. The older red-headed woman investigates the sound, but nothing is there.

The Cowboy appears in the doorway of Diane Selwyns bedroom saying, "Hey, pretty girl. Time to wake up." Diane Selwyn (played by Watts) wakes up in her bed. She looks exactly like Betty but is portrayed as a failed actress driven into a deep depression by her unrequited love for Camilla Rhodes (played by Harring). On Camillas invitation, Diane attends a party at Adams house on Mulholland Drive. Her limousine stops before they reach the house and Camilla escorts her using a shortcut. Adam appears to be in love with Camilla. Over dinner, Diane states that she came to Hollywood when her aunt died, and she met Camilla at an audition for The Sylvia North Story. Another woman (played by George) kisses Camilla and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make an important announcement, but they dissolve into laughter and kiss while Diane watches, crying.

Diane meets with Messing at Winkies, where she gives him Camillas photo and a large amount of money, and they are served by a waitress named Betty. Messing tells Diane that when the job is done, she will find a blue key. Diane asks what, if anything, the key opens, but Messing just laughs. Diane looks up and sees the man who had the nightmare standing at the counter. The blue box is shown in possession of the monster around the back of the diner. Back at her apartment, with the blue key on a table in front of her, Diane is terrorized by hallucinations of the elderly couple. She runs screaming to her bed, where she shoots herself. In the final scene, a woman previously seen at the club whispers "Silencio."

==Production==

===Development=== Touchstone Television ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only on the story of Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, "I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. Shes not just in trouble—she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, What happens next? And David said, You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you." 

Lynch described the attractiveness of the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: "Im a sucker for a continuing story   Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that."    The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynchs earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Ritas identity, Bettys career and Adam Keshers film project. 

Actress Sherilyn Fenn stated in a 2014 interview that the original idea came during the filming of Twin Peaks, as a Spin-off (media)|spin-off film for her character of Audrey Horne.   

===Casting===
Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring by their photographs. He called them in separately for half-hour interviews and told them he had not seen either of their previous works in film or television.    Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident on the way to the first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film.  Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package."    Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.   

===Filming===
  Filming for the television pilot began on location in Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule.   Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), Ann Millers character cigarette smoking and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I dont like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it because we had a deadline, and there wasnt time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because theyre bad-quality tapes, too. I dont want to think about it." 

The script was later rewritten and expanded when Lynch decided to transform it into a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, "One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, and it was a most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle   Now, looking back, I see that   always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is."    The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward.    Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7&nbsp;million from French production company StudioCanal. 

Theroux described approaching filming without entirely understanding what the plot was about: "You get the whole script, but he might as well withhold the scenes youre not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he wont answer any of them   You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadnt demonstrated any command of this method, Id probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him."    Theroux noted the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Therouxs character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the casts frustration. 

==Themes and interpretations==
Giving the film only the tagline, "A love story in the city of dreams",  David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drive s meaning or symbolism, leading to much discussion and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynchs earlier films.  On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynchs feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, "I think hes genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. He loves it when people come up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." 

===Dreams and alternative realities===
An early interpretation of the film uses dream analysis to explain that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful "Betty Elms", reconstructing her history and persona into something like an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Dianes real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable to cope with the guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.   

This interpretation was similar to what Naomi Watts construed, when she said in an interview, "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and shes in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her as if she were a doll. Rita is Bettys fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be."  Watts own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Dianes. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely."   
 BBC rejects the theory of Bettys life as Dianes dream, but also warns against too much analysis. 
 parallel universes epistemological uncertainty in Lynchs film".    The monstrous being from the dream, who is the subject of conversation of the men in Winkies, reappears at the end of the movie right before and after Diane commits suicide. Bulkeley asserts that the lone discussion of dreams in that scene presents an opening to "a new way of understanding everything that happens in the movie". 

Philosopher and film theorist Robert Sinnerbrink similarly notes that the images following Dianes apparent suicide undermine the "dream and reality" interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, the bed is consumed with smoke and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers "Silencio" as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the "concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image", also noting that it might be that the "last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Dianes dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final Silencio".    Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that "the ninety-second coda that follows Betty/Dianes suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked".   

Film theorist David Roche writes that Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but they force the audience into the role of becoming detectives themselves to make sense of the narratives, and that Mulholland Drive, like other Lynch films, frustrates "the spectators need for a rational diegesis by playing on the spectators mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis". In Lynchs films, the spectator is always "one step behind narration" and thus "narration prevails over diegesis".    Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that Mulholland Drive is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together "by the spectator-detectives desire to make sense" of it. 

===A "poisonous valentine to Hollywood"===
Regardless of the proliferation of theories, critics note that no explanation satisfies all of the loose ends and questions that arise from the film. Stephen Holden of The New York Times writes, "Mulholland Drive has little to do with any single characters love life or professional ambition. The movie is an ever-deepening reflection on the allure of Hollywood and on the multiple role-playing and self-invention that the movie-going experience promises   What greater power is there than the power to enter and to program the dream life of the culture?"    J. Hoberman from The Village Voice echoes this sentiment by calling it a "poisonous valentine to Hollywood".

Mulholland Drive has been compared with   (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) in a city of lethal illusions".    The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, "At night, you ride on the top of the world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but its mysterious, and theres a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road."  Watts also had experience with the road before her career was established: "I remember driving along the street many times sobbing my heart out in my car, going, What am I doing here?" 
 Steven Dillon writes that Mulholland Drive is critical of the culture of Hollywood as much as it is a condemnation of "cinephilia" (the fascination of filmmaking and the fantasies associated with it). 

Harring described her interpretation after seeing the film: "When I saw it the first time, I thought it was the story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it   Theres no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. Its a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. Ive heard over and over, This is a movie that Ill see again or This is a movie youve got to see again. It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I dont think its a movie to be gotten. Its achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." 

===Romantic content===
Treatment of the relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla varied between those who were honestly touched by their sincerity and those who were titillated. A review of the film by   as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor states, "Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety its like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the films dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed." 

An analysis of the film in terms of the lesbian as a tragic figure notes the media response to the film: "reviewers rhapsodized in particular and at length about the films sex scenes, as if there were a contest to see who could enjoy this representation of female same-sex desire the most."    The author, Heather Love, writes that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are "understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic" as "the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman". 

Media portrayals of Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harrings views of their onscreen relationships were varied and conflicting. Watts said of the filming of the scene, "I dont see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had tears in my eyes because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit."  However, in another interview Watts stated, "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic."  While Harring was quoted saying, "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Ritas very grateful for the help Bettys given   so Im saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, from the bottom of my heart, I kiss her and then theres just an energy that takes us  . Of course I have amnesia so I dont know if Ive done it before, but I dont think were really lesbians."    Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harrings perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." 

==Characters==
 ). Betty is bright and optimistic, in contrast with Watts portrayal of Diane in the later part of the film.]]
Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is the bright and talented newcomer to Los Angeles, described as "wholesome, optimistic, determined to take the town by storm",  and "absurdly naïve".    Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita because it is the right thing to do is reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers.      Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché of small-town naïveté. But it is Bettys identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the films consciousness and unconscious.  Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone "who finds herself in a world she doesnt belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if its somebody elses".  This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naively, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a "complicit actor" who had "embraced the very structure that" destroyed her.  In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated:

 I had to therefore come up with my own decisions about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.  

Film critic  , Ontario, shares the same name as the apartment building of Blue Velvet s femme fatale, Dorothy. Having been freed from her small-town constrictions, Sandy is reborn as Betty, drawn to a dark-haired mystery woman like Dorothy, and falls in love with her and loses herself. 

Betty, however difficult to believe as her character is established, shows an astonishing depth of dimension in her audition.     Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, the scene is "dreck"  and "hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actresss commitment", and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written.  Nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, but when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in every person in the room. The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts Bettys previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynchs use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters.  Bettys acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a movie that ultimately turns against her. 

Rita (Laura Elena Herring) is the mysterious and helpless apparent victim, a classic femme fatale with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert was so impressed with Harring that he said of her "all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55&nbsp;years for a Gilda remake".  She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Bettys bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire to make sense of the film through her identity.  Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, that one reviewer notes is "the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlookers willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her".  A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave.  Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynchs films, states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Ritas fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Ritas anxiety about her loss of identity.  According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane. 

 

After Betty and Rita find the decomposing body, they flee the apartment and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Ritas lack of identity causes a breakdown that "occurs not only at the level of the character but also at the level of the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters".  Immediately they return to Bettys aunts apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig—ostensibly to disguise herself—but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Ritas personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla. 

Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts) is the palpably frustrated and depressed woman, who seems to have ridden the coattails of Camilla, whom she idolizes and adores, but who does not return her affection. She is considered to be the reality of the too-good-to-be-true Betty, or a later version of Betty after living too long in Hollywood.  For Steven Dillon, the plot of the film "makes Rita the perfect empty vessel for Dianes fantasies", but because Rita is only a "blank cover girl" Diane has "invested herself in emptiness", which leads her to depression and apparently to suicide.  Hence, Diane is the personification of dissatisfaction, painfully illustrated when she is unable to climax while masturbating, in a scene that indicates "through blurred, jerky, point of view shots of the stony wall—not only her tears and humiliation but the disintegration of her fantasy and her growing desire for revenge".  One analysis of Diane suggests her devotion to Camilla is based on a manifestation of narcissism, as Camilla embodies everything Diane wants and wants to be.    Although she is portrayed as weak and the ultimate loser, for Jeff Johnson, author of a book about morality in Lynch films, Diane is the only character in the second portion of the film whose moral code remains intact. She is "a decent person corrupted by the miscellaneous miscreants who populate the film industry".  Her guilt and regret are evident in her suicide, and in the clues that surface in the first portion of the film. Ritas fear, the dead body and the illusion at Club Silencio indicate something is dark and wrong in Betty and Ritas world. In becoming free from Camilla, her moral conditioning kills her. 

Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) is little more than a face in a photo and a name that has inspired many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam. Referred to as a "vapid moll" by one reviewer,    she barely makes an impression in the first portion of the film, but after the blue box is opened and she is portrayed by Laura Elena Harring, she becomes a full person who symbolizes "betrayal, humiliation and abandonment",  and is the object of Dianes frustration. Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have "sucked the life out of Diane".  Immediately after telling Diane that she drives her wild, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a movie set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane—at Camillas request—where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Dianes conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Dianes desire for Camilla.   

Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is established in the first portion of the film as a "vaguely arrogant",  but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another. Theroux said of his role, "Hes sort of the one character in the film who doesnt know what the   going on. I think hes the one guy the audience says, Im kind of like you right now. I dont know why youre being subjected to all this pain."  After being stripped of creative control of his film, he is cuckolded by the pool cleaner (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), and thrown out of his own opulent house above Hollywood. After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from the first part of the film to the second.  One analysis of Adams character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Bettys cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power. 
 Monty Montgomery, credited as Lafayette Montgomery), the Castigliani Brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti) and Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson), all of whom are somehow involved in pressuring Adam to cast Camilla Rhodes in his film. These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars,   and they portray a "vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives".  Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, in the first part of the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adams mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Dianes embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.

The filmmaking style of David Lynch has been written about extensively using descriptions like "ultraweird",  "dark"  and "oddball".  Todd McGowan writes, "One cannot watch a Lynch film the way one watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films."  Through Lynchs juxtaposition of cliché and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing.  Many of the characters in Mulholland Drive are archetypes that can only be perceived as cliché: the new Hollywood hopeful, the femme fatale, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully.  Lynch places these often hackneyed characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst writes of him, "Like most surrealists, Lynchs language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams." 
 dwarf actor prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small.  During Adam and Camillas party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate "cruel and Psychological manipulation|manipulative" act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Dianes paranoia is allowing the audience only to see what she senses.  In a scene immediately after Bettys audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." 
 nonlinear narration and intertextuality. 

 

The first portion of the film that establishes the characters of Betty, Rita and Adam presents some of the most logical filmmaking of Lynchs career.   The later part of the film that represents reality to many viewers, however, exhibits a marked change in cinematic effect that gives it a quality just as surreal as the first part. Dianes scenes feature choppier editing and dirtier lighting that symbolize her physical and spiritual impoverishment,  which contrasts with the first portion of the film where "even the plainest decor seems to sparkle", Betty and Rita glow with light and transitions between scenes are smooth.    Lynch moves between scenes in the first portion of the film by using panoramic shots of the mountains, palm trees and buildings in Los Angeles. In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camillas party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Dianes hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkies after Dianes suicide, or the "repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured" in the early portion of the film, creates the   of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object—primarily the blue box—that initiates Ritas disappearance and Dianes real life. 

Another recurring element in Lynchs films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, "you look at the image and the scene silent, its doing the job its supposed to do, but the work isnt done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. Theres so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes its really magical."  In the opening scene of the film, the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added "a hint of the steam   and the screaming kids", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified.  Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects.    Hageman also identifies "perpetual and uncanny ambient sound", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkies as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise "creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order".  Mulholland Drive s ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering is an example of Lynchs aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, "The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma." 

== Soundtrack ==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=The album progresses much like a typical Lynch film, opening with a quick, pleasant Jitterbug and then slowly delving into darker string passages, the twangy guitar sounds of 50s diner music and, finally, the layered, disturbing, often confusing underbelly of the score.

: Neil Shurley, 2002 }}

The soundtrack of Mulholland Drive was supervised by Angelo Badalamenti, who collaborated on previous Lynch projects Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks.    Badalamenti, who was nominated for awards from the American Film Institute (AFI) and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for his work on the film,       also has a cameo as an espresso aficionado and mobster.

Reviewers note that Badalamentis ominous score, described as his "darkest yet",    contributes to the sense of mystery as the film opens on the dark-haired womans limousine,  that contrasts with the bright, hopeful tones of Bettys first arrival in Los Angeles,  with the score "acting as an emotional guide for the viewer".  Film music journalist Daniel Schweiger remarks that Badalamentis contribution to the score alternates from the "nearly motionless string dread to noir jazz and audio feedback", with "the rhythms building to an explosion of infinite darkness."    Badalamenti described a particular technique of sound design applied to the film, by which he would provide Lynch with multiple ten- to twelve-minute tracks at slow tempo, that they called "firewood",  from which Lynch "would take fragments and experiment with them resulting in a lot of films eerie soundscapes." 

Lynch uses two pop songs from the 1960s directly after one another, playing as two actresses are auditioning by lip synching them. According to an analyst of music used in Lynch films, Lynchs female characters are often unable to communicate through normal channels and are reduced to lip-synching or being otherwise stifled.    Connie Stevens "Sixteen Reasons" is the song being sung while the camera pans backwards to reveal several illusions, and Linda Scotts version of "Ive Told Evry Little Star" is the audition for the first Camilla Rhodes, that film scholar Eric Gans considers a song of empowerment for Betty.    Originally written by Jerome Kern as a duet, sung by Linda Scott in this rendition by herself, Gans suggests it takes on a homosexual overtone in Mulholland Drive   Unlike "Sixteen Reasons", however, portions of "Ive Told Evry Little Star" are distorted to suggest "a sonic split-identity" for Camilla.  When the song plays, Betty has just entered the sound stage where Adam is auditioning actresses for his film, and she sees Adam, locks eyes with him and abruptly flees after Adam has declared "This is the girl" about Camilla, thereby avoiding his inevitable rejection.

===Critical reception===
Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, according to two film scholars, "garnered both some of the harshest epithets and some of the most lavish praise in recent cinematic history".  It received acclaim from many critics, such as   called it "exhilarating   for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" and added, "theres a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere   it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146&nbsp;minutes   proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." 

In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers observed, "Mulholland Drive makes movies feel alive again. This sinful pleasure is a fresh triumph for Lynch, and one of the best films of a sorry-ass year. For visionary daring, swooning eroticism and colors that pop like a whores lip gloss, theres nothing like this baby anywhere."  J. Hoberman of The Village Voice stated, "This voluptuous phantasmagoria   is certainly Lynchs strongest movie since Blue Velvet and maybe Eraserhead. The very things that failed him in the bad-boy rockabilly debacle of Lost Highway—the atmosphere of free-floating menace, pointless transmigration of souls, provocatively dropped plot stitches, gimcrack alternate universes—are here brilliantly rehabilitated." 

While reviews of the film were mostly positive (receiving an 81% rating on movie   notes, "You wouldnt need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldnt need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls." 
 Time Out Michael Phillips arthouse film Slate named Mulholland Drive in its piece on "New Classics" as the most enduring film since 2000. 

Sight & Sound ranked Mulholland Drive 28th on their list of the fifty greatest films ever on August 2, 2012.  It is one of only two films from the 21st century to be included in the list, along with 2000s In the Mood for Love.

===Home media===
A DVD was released in April 2002 in the United States and Canada, with few special features. It was released without chapter stops, a feature that Lynch objects to on the grounds that it "demystifies" the film.  In spite of Lynchs concerns, the DVD release included a cover insert that provided "David Lynchs 10 Clues to Unlocking This Thriller", although one DVD reviewer noted the clues may be "big obnoxious red herrings".  Nick Coccellato of Eccentric Cinema gave the film a rating of nine out of ten and the DVD release an eight out of ten, saying that the lack of special features "only adds to the mystery the film itself possesses, in abundance."    Special features in later versions and overseas versions of the DVD include a Lynch interview at the Cannes Film Festival and highlights of the debut of the film at Cannes.
