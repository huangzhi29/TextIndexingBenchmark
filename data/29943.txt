==Plot==
 
 
 
On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students report at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. for all-day detention at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois, "60062" (actually the Zip Code of Northbrook, Illinois), a suburb of Chicago. While not complete strangers, each comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common: the beautiful and pampered Claire Standish (a "princess"), the state champion wrestler Andrew Clarke (an "athlete"), the bookish Brian Johnson (a "brain"), the reclusive outcast Allison Reynolds (a "basket case"), and the rebellious John Bender (a "criminal").

They gather in the high school library, where assistant principal Richard Vernon instructs them not to speak, move from their seats, or sleep for the next eight hours and 54 minutes (i.e., until 4 p.m.). He assigns them a 1,000-word essay, in which each must describe "who you think you are". He then leaves, returning only occasionally to check on them. Bender, who has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Vernon, ignores the rules and frequently riles up the other students, teasing Brian and Andrew and harassing Claire. Allison is initially quiet, except for the occasional random outburst.
 cannabis that Bender retrieves from his locker. Gradually, they open up to each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cant easily think for himself; John comes from an abusive household; Brian has attempted suicide due to a bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends. They also discover they all have strained relationships with their parents: Allisons parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrews father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; Johns father verbally and physically abuses both John and his mother; Brians parents put immense pressure on him to get good grades and keep it that way; and Claires parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. The students realize that even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives.

Despite the differences in social status, the group begins to form friendships (and even romantic relationships) as the day progresses. Claire makes it her mission to show Allison just how pretty she really is, and Allisons new look sparks the romantic interest of Andrew, who is stunned when Allisons beauty is revealed. Claire decides to break her "pristine" virgin appearance by kissing Bender in the closet and giving him a hickey. Although they suspect the relationships will end with the end of their detention, the students mutual experiences change the way they look at their peers afterward.

As the detention comes to its final moments, the group requests that Brian complete the essay for everyone, and Brian agrees, leaving the essay in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. The students part ways outside the school. Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrews state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads Brians essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, "in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions: a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal". Brian signs the letter: "The Breakfast Club". As the movie ends, John raises his fist in triumph as he walks across the football field for home.

==Production==

===Casting===
Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall were both in Hughes 1984 film Sixteen Candles. Towards the end of filming, Hughes asked them both to be in The Breakfast Club. Hall became the first to be cast, agreeing to the role of Brian Johnson. Ringwald was originally approached to play the character of Allison Reynolds, but she was "really upset" because she wanted to play Claire Standish. She eventually convinced the director and the studio to give her the part.  The role of Allison ultimately went to Ally Sheedy.

Emilio Estevez originally auditioned for the role of John Bender. However, when John Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clarke, Estevez was recast. Nicolas Cage was considered for the role of John Bender, which was the last to be cast, though the role came down to John Cusack and Judd Nelson. Hughes eventually cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes got angry at Nelson because he stayed in character by taunting Ringwald off-camera, and the other actors had to convince Hughes not to fire him.    

Rick Moranis was originally cast as the janitor but left due to creative differences and was replaced by John Kapelos. 

===Filming===
In 1999, Hughes said his request to direct the film met resistance and skepticism because he lacked filmmaking experience. Hughes won the investors over with his argument that due to the films low budget of $1 million and its single-location shoot, the risks involved were minimal. 

Hughes originally thought The Breakfast Club would be his directorial debut. Because of his inexperience, he set the film in one room and wrote it about high school students, who would be played by younger actors. 

Principal photography began on March 28, 1984 and ended in May of that year. Filming took place at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, Illinois, which had closed in 1981. (The building was later used for some of the scenes in Hughess Ferris Buellers Day Off (1986 in film|1986), released one year after The Breakfast Club.)

The library at Maine North High School was considered too small for the film, so the crew built the set in the schools gymnasium.  The actors rehearsed with each other for three weeks and then shot the film in sequence.  Some of the posters on the walls during filming of The Breakfast Club were still there when Ferris Bueller was filmed, and on the Ferris Buellers Day Off DVD commentary  (featured on the 2004 DVD version), John Hughes revealed that he shot the two films back-to-back to save time and money, and some outtakes of both films feature elements of the film crews working on the other film. 

The first print was 150 minutes long.    During a cast reunion in honor of the films 25th anniversary, Ally Sheedy revealed that it was Hughes directors cut, but Hughes widow did not disclose any details concerning its whereabouts.   

===Themes===
The main theme of the film is the constant struggle of the American teenager to be understood, by adults and by themselves.  It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures.  
On the surface, the students have little in common with each other.  However, as the day rolls on, they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations. Loukides, Paul (1996).  . Popular Press. pp. 30-32.   The main adult character, Mr. Vernon, is not portrayed in a positive light. He consistently talks down to the students and flaunts his authority throughout the film. Bender is the only one who stands up to Vernon. 

Stereotyping is another theme. Once the obvious stereotypes are broken down, the characters "empathize with each others struggles, dismiss some of the inaccuracies of their first impressions, and discover that they are more similar than different." 

===Poster===
The films poster, featuring the five characters huddled together, was photographed by Annie Leibovitz toward the end of shooting. The shot of five actors gazing at the camera influenced the way teen films were marketed from that point on.  The poster refers to the five "types" of the story using slightly different terms than those used in the film, and in a different sequence, stating "They were five total strangers with nothing in common, meeting for the first time. A brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse."

Sheedy, Ringwald, and Hall appeared together on stage, with Kapelos in the audience; Gleason gave the award to his former castmates. Estevez could not attend because of other commitments, and Nelson appeared earlier in the show but left before the on-stage reunion, prompting Hall to joke that the two were "in Africa with Dave Chappelle".  Rock band Yellowcard performed Simple Minds anthem for the film, "Dont You (Forget About Me)", at the awards. 

At the 82nd Academy Awards (March 7, 2010), Sheedy, Hall, Ringwald, and Nelson all appeared in a tribute to John Hughes - who had died a few months prior - along with other actors who had worked with him, including Jon Cryer from Pretty in Pink (1986), Matthew Broderick from Ferris Buellers Day Off (1986), and Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone (1990).
