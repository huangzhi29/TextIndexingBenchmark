 Australian science science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called "the Matrix", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer "Neo (The Matrix)|Neo" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the "dream world".
 shot to Japanese animation fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.
 BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The films premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.
 greatest science fiction films,        --> and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation.  The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowskis, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The The Matrix (franchise)|Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved.

==Plot== Trinity (Carrie-Anne Agents the police do so anyway, and are easily defeated. The Agents chase Trinity over the rooftops; she ends up in a phone booth, with the Agents driving a truck into it. As they collide, she picks up the phone and vanishes. 
 computer programmer hacker under Morpheus (Laurence red pill. His reality soon disintegrates and he abruptly awakens in a liquid-filled vessel, finding himself as one of billions of people connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheuss hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar.
 intelligent machines simulation of the world as it was in 1999 in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified; Neo has been living in it since birth. Morpheus and his crew belong to a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix and "unplug" enslaved humans, recruiting them as rebels. The rebels understanding of the true nature of the simulated reality allows them to bend its physical laws, granting them seemingly superhuman abilities. Neo is warned that fatal injuries within the Matrix will also kill ones physical body, and that the Agents he encountered are powerful sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system. Neos skill during virtual combat training lends credence to Morpheuss belief that Neo is "the One", a man prophesied to end the war between humans and machines.
 Oracle (Gloria Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), a crew member disillusioned with the harshness of the real world. Cypher secretly betrayed Morpheus to Agent Smith in exchange for a return to a comfortable life within the Matrix. Cypher disconnects and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world, before he is killed by Tank (Marcus Chong), a crewman whom he had left for dead.

In the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus in an attempt to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion (The Matrix)|Zion, the rebel humans last refuge in the real world. Believing that he is not the One, Neo proposes returning to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, and Trinity insists she accompany him. They succeed in rescuing their leader, and in doing so, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats on par with those of the Agents. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. In the real world, "sentinel" machines attack the Nebuchadnezzar, while Trinity stands over Neo and whispers to him that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo, and he revives with newfound powers to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly destroys Smith and leaves the Matrix in time for the ships electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the attacking sentinels.

Some time later, Neo makes a telephone call in the Matrix, promising the Machines he will show their prisoners "a world where anything is possible". He ends the call and flies into the sky.

==Cast==
*   turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West, because of skepticism over the films ambitious bullet-time special effects.    He later stated he was "not mature enough as an actor" at that time,  and that if given the role, he "would have messed it up".   Nicolas Cage also turned down the part because of "family obligations".  Warner Bros. sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer for the role. When both declined, the studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role over Johnny Depp, the Wachowskis first choice.    Architect in the sequels, not that of Morpheus.

Wonderland Magazine, February 2010, page 148     In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the Intro and Outro interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline (Janet Jackson album)|Discipline.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins (film)|Assassins to Warner Brothers. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, Bound and The Matrix, in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, Bound, then became a critical success. Using this momentum, the brothers later asked to direct The Matrix. 

Producer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters like Silver and Di Bonaventura to influence the company, The Matrix was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects.  The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film.  The storyboard eventually earned the studios approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget.  Soon, The Matrix became a co-production of Warner Bros. and the Australian company Village Roadshow Pictures.   

===Pre-production===
The actors of the film were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix.   , and Evolutionary Psychology even before they opened up the script,  and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved.  Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process. 
 martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu, the actors had to train hard for several months.  The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training. Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.   

Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actors strength. He built on Reeves diligence, Fishburnes resilience, Weavings precision, and Mosss feminine grace.  Yuen designed Moss moves to suit her deftness and lightness.    Prior to the pre-production, Reeves suffered a two-level fusion of his cervical spine which had begun to cause paralysis in his legs, requiring him to undergo neck surgery. He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film.  Weaving had to undergo a hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process. 

===Production design===
 
In the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code utilizes a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley,    which includes mirror images of  , and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence. 
 Owen Paterson, sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the "real world", the actors hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors. 

The Nebuchadnezzar was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on films like Star Trek. The wires were made visible to show the ships working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as "a marriage between Man and Machine".    For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used, and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.   

Kym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume.    For example, Reeves office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place.    Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses.  For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinitys costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character.  For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film JFK (film)|JFK.   

The sunglasses, a staple to the films aesthetics, were commissioned for the film to designer Richard Walker from sunglass maker Blinde Design. 

===Filming=== Fox Studios in Sydney, Australia, and in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included in order to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center.  The principal photography took 118 days. 
 Martin Places fountain in Sydney, half-way between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself.    During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work.   
 Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films.  During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.   

The dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Because of Reevess injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to the filming, he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.   

For the subway scene, the set was first planned to be shot in a real subway station, but due to the amount of the actions and the wire works, the decision was made to shoot on set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot where Neo was slammed into a booth.    The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view of the building was a large, several-story high sheet of background. The helicopter was a full-scale light-weight mock-up, and its blades were added post-production by the visual effects team.   

To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography.  According to The Art of the Matrix, at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film.   

===Visual effects===
  setup, while the cameras were fired in rapid succession, with fractions of a second delay between each shot. The result was combined with CGI backgrounds to create the final effect at (0:33).|alt=Video sample of the film]]

  }}
 shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.    Bullet time has been described as "a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix",  and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters exertion of control over time and space.  The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Manex Visual Effects to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the films visual effects supervisor.   

The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera is a still-picture camera not a motion picture camera, and it contributes just one frame to the video sequence. When those pictures are shown in sequence, they create the effect of "virtual camera movement"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time. 
 previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect.  When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film.  Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side.  To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.
 cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the films visual effects.  

Manex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neos jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.   

The photogrametric and image-based Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated background approaches in The Matrix s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters motions and expressions. It also led to the development of "Universal Capture", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras. 

===Sound effects and music===
 
Dane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scenes sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human baby closing required almost fifty sounds put together.   
 contrapuntal ideas. Davis score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.

}} doctrine of the book used to conceal disks,    and Morpheus quotes its phrase "desert of the real".    The book was required reading for the actors prior to filming.   Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work.  

Interpretations of The Matrix often reference Baudrillards philosophy to demonstrate that the film is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of Bracha Ettinger articulated in a series of books and essays from the end of the 1980s onwards was brought to the publics attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock   and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel.  Bracha Ettingers matrixial theory is referred to explicitly quite late in the film through the expression "primal matrix" but it is visualized from the beginning via the alliance between Neo, Trinity and Morpheus, their “co-birthing” in a womb-like “shareable time-space”, their co-existence in different dimension at the same time, their relation to the maternal oracle and more. Her “archaic” matrix is always in the now and the future, it depends on human affects and desires and proposes a different relations between the symbolic and the real. This Matrix is fragile yet it is resistant to the dominating Matrix of the mechanical coded simulated and manipulated consciousness that forecloses and rejects it. In the Ettingerian matrixial sphere freedom goes together with responsibility. The links between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the Oracle, right from the very beginning and all along the film, manifest the possibility of "transconnectedness" in proximity and in distance, which is not global and cant form a “web of webs”. Its webs are always specific, invested by an "Eros of borderlinking" and related to different processes thet Ettinger has named “metramorphosis” (feminine-maternal-material morpheus).     This is then another kind of Matrix hidden behind the Baudrillard kind.
 Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer, and believed that The Matrix was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick.  Other writers have also commented on the similarities between The Matrix and Dicks work.     
 Japanese animation Mamoru Oshiis Ghost in the Shell was a particularly strong influence;  producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for The Matrix by showing him that anime and saying, "We wanna do that for real".       Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced Ghost in the Shell, noted that the animes high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. Id imagine that The Matrix is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios". He stated that since Ghost in the Shell had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a "promotional tool".    The action scenes of The Matrix were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo.  The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Woo-ping as fight choreographer.  

The film makes several references to   as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making The Matrix.       
 Strange Days, Dark City, and The Truman Show.          Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrisons comic series The Invisibles; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film.    Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda.  Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality. 

===Philosophical influences===
Once one accepts The Matrix as a generated reality of malicious machines invention then this is Descartes First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnams brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s.  One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Platos Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Platos theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception. 

Immanuel Kant also has an influence on how the individuals within The Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his Critique of Pure Reason that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means we ourselves are our own agents of deceit, and so in order for one to know truth, one must choose to openly pursue truth. One may examine this explicitly in the scene that contains Agent Smiths monologue about  the first version of the Matrix, which was to be a Human Utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith exclaims, “it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops   were lost.” The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived The Matrix in the image of the 1999s world. The 1999s world was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. This is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content to remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans are not easy to make content. This means Mankind still has a hand in their future, and at least at some level still they have the ability to revive their freedom, even with the machines holding all the cards and having control over of the system.

Worldwide it was the fourth highest grossing film of the year.    it is placed 122nd on the list of highest grossing films of all time, and the second highest grossing film in the Matrix franchise after The Matrix Reloaded ($742.1 million). 

===Critical reception=== average score of 7.6/10, based upon a sample of 139 reviews.  At Metacritic, which assigns an average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 73 upon its DVD release, based on 35 reviews. 
 Time Out praised the "entertainingly ingenious" switches between different realities, Hugo Weavings "engagingly odd" performance, and the films cinematography and production design, but concluded, "the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic&nbsp;... yet another slice of overlong, high concept hokum."   

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as "simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... Theres not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch its become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome."    Film critic Nick Davis strongly disliked The Matrix, criticizing aspects such as its unoriginality and its attitudes toward race and gender, concluding that the Wachowskis had raised the bar of filmmaking and special effects, only to waste it on hackneyed, impersonal and political tripe.   

Ian Nathan of Empire (magazine)|Empire described Carrie-Anne Moss as "a major find", praised the "surreal visual highs" enabled by the bullet time (or "flo-mo") effect, and described the film as "technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool". Nathan remarked that although the films "looney plot" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because "The Matrix is about pure experience".    Maitland McDonagh said in her review for TV Guide, "The Wachowskis through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the films lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains. ... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits."   

Salon (website)|Salon s reviewer Andrew OHehir acknowledged that The Matrix is a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film ("It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the overamped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside"), but concluded, "as in Bound, theres an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for movies—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep."   
 
Several science fiction creators commented on the film. Author   failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen."    Director Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favourite movies from 1992 to 2009.

==Legacy==
The Matrix had a strong effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The films incorporation of   (2000)  and Charlies Angels (film)|Charlies Angels (2000),  and Yuen Woo-pings brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on Daredevil (film)|Daredevil (2003).  The Matrix s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.   

Following The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the   (1999),    (2010).   
 shootings at Columbine High School.
