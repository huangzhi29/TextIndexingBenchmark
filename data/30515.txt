==Plot== American West to join his fiancée Patricia (Carroll Baker) at the enormous ranch owned by her father, Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford), referred to by all as the "Major". Terrill has been feuding with Rufus Hannassey (Burl Ives), the patriarch of a poorer, less refined ranching clan, over water rights in the arid grazing lands of the high plains.

Patricias friend, schoolteacher Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons), owns the "Big Muddy", a large ranch itself, with a source of water that is vital to Hannassey.  Julie allows all to water their cattle and refuses to sell or lease Big Muddy to either side, so as to keep the fragile peace.

Meanwhile, McKay repeatedly refuses to be provoked into proving his manhood; he tells the Major his father died in a meaningless duel. He does nothing when Hannasseys trouble-making son Buck (Chuck Connors) and his shiftless companions harass him. He also declines an invitation by Terrills foreman, Steve Leech (Charlton Heston), to ride an infamous, unbroken horse named "Old Thunder". Consequently, everyone, including Patricia, consider him to be a coward. When the Major and his men ride to the Hannassey canyon ranch in retribution for Bucks harassment of a Terrill guest, McKay pointedly declines to participate. McKay then breaks Old Thunder, after being thrown out of the saddle numerous times. He swears ranch hand Ramon (Alfonso Bedoya), the only witness to McKays triumph, to secrecy.

One morning, McKay rides out to the Big Muddy and persuades Julie to sell him her land, promising to continue her policy of unrestricted access to the river. A search party spends two days looking for McKay, believing he has gotten lost. McKay explains that he was not in danger, but Leech calls him a liar. When McKay again refuses to be goaded into a fight, he sees that Patricia is disappointed in him; they agree to reconsider their engagement. Early the next morning, before anybody else is up, McKay settles his quarrel with Leech. They fight, without witnesses, to an exhausted draw.

Later, Julie tells her friend Patricia that he bought the Big Muddy for her. Patricia goes to see him, but when he tells her his plans to give Hannassey access to his water, she breaks their engagement.

Meanwhile, on Terrills orders, Leech and his men chase Hannasseys cattle away from the Big Muddy. Hannassey, in retaliation, kidnaps Julie and uses her as bait to lure Terrill into an ambush in the narrow canyon leading to Hannasseys homestead. Buck tries to force himself on Julie, but his father stops him.  Buck, furious, tries to strangle his father, but is overpowered.  His father states, "One day I know Im going to have to kill you".  

When McKay finds out about Julie, he rides to the Hannassey place with Ramon. McKay shows Hannassey the deed to Big Muddy and promises him equal access to the water. When Hannassey says he intends to fight Terrill anyway, McKay tells him that it is just a personal vendetta between two old men.

When it becomes obvious that McKay and Julie have feelings for each other, Buck attacks McKay.  They fight, but Hannassey steps in when Buck draws his gun on the unarmed McKay, and insists on a formal duel. After walking apart ten paces, Buck fires before the signal, grazing McKays forehead. Hannassey is furious. Then McKay slowly takes aim. Buck drops to the ground in terror and crawls behind a wheel. After McKay fires into the dirt, Hannassey spits on Buck in disgust. As McKay and Julie start to leave, Buck grabs a gun, forcing Hannassey to shoot his son dead.

Meanwhile, Terrill insists on riding into the canyon. Initially, Leech and the rest of his men refuse to accompany him. However, after Terrill rides out alone, Leech joins him, followed by the rest of the outfit. They are quickly pinned down. However, Hannassey acknowledges the truth of McKays accusation, orders his men to stop shooting and challenges Terrill to a one-on-one showdown. Terrill promptly agrees. Hannassey and Terrill, armed with rifles, then kill each other.

McKay and Julie ride off to start a new life together.
